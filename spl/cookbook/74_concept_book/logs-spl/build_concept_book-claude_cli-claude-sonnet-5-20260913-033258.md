## Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin is a protein packed inside red blood cells whose job is to pick up oxygen in the lungs, carry it through the bloodstream, and release it wherever tissues need it. Structurally, it is a tetramer: four separate protein chains (two alpha and two beta subunits in adult humans) bundled together, each cradling a heme group — a ring-shaped molecule with an iron atom at its center. Iron is what actually binds oxygen; each of the four subunits can bind one $O_2$ molecule, so one hemoglobin molecule carries up to four oxygen molecules at a time.

The key functional feature is that binding is *cooperative*, not independent. When the first oxygen molecule attaches to one subunit, it triggers a subtle shape change that ripples through the other three subunits, making them bind oxygen more readily. This is why hemoglobin's oxygen-saturation curve is S-shaped (sigmoidal) rather than a simple rising curve: at low oxygen concentration, binding is slow to start, but once it begins, saturation rises steeply, then levels off near 100%. Compare a hypothetical protein that bound oxygen independently at each site — its saturation curve would be a smooth hyperbola, rising quickly at low oxygen and gradually flattening, with no steep middle section.

This cooperativity has direct physiological payoff. In the oxygen-rich lungs, hemoglobin loads up almost completely. In oxygen-poor tissues, it unloads a large fraction of its cargo over a narrow range of oxygen partial pressure — precisely where the curve is steepest. A non-cooperative carrier would release oxygen more sluggishly and less efficiently across that same pressure range, delivering less oxygen to tissues that need it most.

This structure-function link is exploited clinically. Carbon monoxide binds the same iron sites far more tightly than oxygen does, and — because of cooperativity — even partial CO binding shifts the whole curve, suppressing oxygen release from the unaffected subunits too. Sickle-cell disease arises from a single amino-acid substitution in the beta chains that causes hemoglobin to polymerize under low-oxygen conditions, distorting red blood cell shape. In both cases, understanding hemoglobin's four-subunit cooperative architecture — not just "it carries oxygen" — is what explains the clinical picture and points toward treatment strategies.

## Partial Pressure

When several gases occupy the same container, each gas behaves as though it alone filled the entire volume. The pressure that a single gas contributes to the total is called its **partial pressure**. This idea is formalized in Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the partial pressures of its individual components:

$$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \dots + P_n$$

Because pressure arises from the frequency and force of molecular collisions with the container walls, and because ideal gas molecules don't interact with one another, each gas's contribution to the total pressure depends only on how many of *its* molecules are present — not on what other gases are mixed in. The partial pressure of any component can be found from the ideal gas law, $P_i V = n_i R T$, or equivalently from the mole fraction: $P_i = x_i \cdot P_{total}$, where $x_i = n_i / n_{total}$.

**Worked example**: A rigid 10.0 L tank at 25°C contains 0.40 mol of nitrogen and 0.10 mol of oxygen. What is the partial pressure of each gas, and the total pressure?

Using $P_i = n_i R T / V$ with $R = 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(mol·K)}$ and $T = 298 \text{ K}$:

$$P_{N_2} = \frac{(0.40)(0.0821)(298)}{10.0} \approx 0.979 \text{ atm}$$
$$P_{O_2} = \frac{(0.10)(0.0821)(298)}{10.0} \approx 0.245 \text{ atm}$$
$$P_{total} = 0.979 + 0.245 = 1.224 \text{ atm}$$

**Problem-solving application**: Partial pressure calculations matter whenever gases are collected or measured in mixed environments. A classic case is collecting a gas over water: the gas produced in a reaction bubbles up through water and collects in an inverted tube, but water itself evaporates, adding its own vapor pressure to the mixture. If a student collects hydrogen gas over water at 20°C where the total pressure is 1.00 atm and the known vapor pressure of water at that temperature is 0.023 atm, then the "dry" hydrogen pressure is found by subtraction: $P_{H_2} = 1.00 - 0.023 = 0.977 \text{ atm}$. This corrected value — not the total measured pressure — is what should be used in further stoichiometric calculations, since including water vapor would overstate the amount of hydrogen actually produced.

## Oxygen Dissociation Curve

The oxygen dissociation curve plots hemoglobin's oxygen saturation (percentage of heme sites bound to $O_2$) against the partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{O_2}$, in the surrounding blood. The curve is sigmoidal, not a simple hyperbola, because hemoglobin's four subunits bind oxygen cooperatively: binding the first $O_2$ molecule shifts hemoglobin's shape, making it easier for the next three sites to bind. This produces a flat lower region (low affinity at low $P_{O_2}$), a steep middle region (rapid saturation change over a narrow pressure range), and a flat upper plateau (near-100% saturation at high $P_{O_2}$).

The curve's position shifts with physiological conditions. Increased $CO_2$, decreased pH, increased temperature, and increased 2,3-BPG all shift the curve to the *right* — this is the Bohr effect. A rightward shift means hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily at any given $P_{O_2}$, which is exactly what's needed in metabolically active tissue: exercising muscle generates $CO_2$ and lactic acid (lowering pH) and heat, all of which push hemoglobin to unload more oxygen where it's needed most.

**Worked example.** In the lungs, $P_{O_2} \approx 100$ mmHg, placing hemoglobin on the curve's plateau at about 98% saturation — loading is nearly complete and insensitive to small pressure changes, which is efficient because it tolerates altitude or ventilation variation without much saturation loss. In resting tissue, $P_{O_2} \approx 40$ mmHg, corresponding to roughly 75% saturation, so about 23 percentage points of oxygen are unloaded. In exercising muscle, local acidity and heat shift the curve right, so at that same 40 mmHg, saturation might drop to only 60%, meaning 38 percentage points are delivered — considerably more oxygen released per unit of blood flow.

**Problem-solving application.** Given a curve or a table of saturation values at two $P_{O_2}$ points, you can calculate oxygen delivered to tissue as $\Delta(\text{saturation}) \times (O_2 \text{ capacity of blood})$. This lets you compare, quantitatively, how a rightward shift (say, during fever or intense exercise) increases oxygen delivery for the same drop in $P_{O_2}$ — a direct application of the curve to explain why fever or heavy exertion increases tissue oxygenation efficiency without requiring any increase in cardiac output.

## Oxygen Transport

**Definition.** Oxygen transport is the process by which oxygen absorbed in the lungs is carried through the bloodstream to tissues throughout the body. About 98% of oxygen travels bound to hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein packed into red blood cells; the remaining 2% dissolves directly in blood plasma. Each hemoglobin molecule contains four oxygen-binding sites, and the fraction of those sites occupied by oxygen is called hemoglobin's **oxygen saturation**. This binding is reversible: hemoglobin loads oxygen where oxygen is abundant (the lungs) and unloads it where oxygen is scarce (metabolically active tissue), driven by differences in oxygen partial pressure ($P_{O_2}$).

**Worked example.** Consider a patient whose arterial blood has a hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dL and an oxygen saturation of 98%. Each gram of fully saturated hemoglobin can carry about 1.34 mL of oxygen. The oxygen carried by hemoglobin per deciliter of blood is:

$$
O_2\text{ content (hemoglobin-bound)} = 1.34 \times [\text{Hb}] \times S_{O_2} = 1.34 \times 15 \times 0.98 \approx 19.7\ \text{mL O}_2/\text{dL}
$$

Dissolved oxygen contributes only about $0.003 \times P_{O_2}$ mL per dL per mmHg, which at a typical arterial $P_{O_2}$ of 100 mmHg adds just 0.3 mL/dL. Total arterial oxygen content is therefore roughly $19.7 + 0.3 = 20.0$ mL O$_2$/dL — confirming that hemoglobin, not plasma, does nearly all the work.

**Problem-solving application.** This relationship explains why patients with anemia (low hemoglobin concentration) can suffer tissue oxygen deprivation even with normal saturation and normal lung function — because oxygen content scales directly with $[\text{Hb}]$. It also clarifies why pulse oximeters, which measure only saturation ($S_{O_2}$), can miss anemia entirely: a patient could read 98% saturated while carrying dangerously little total oxygen if their hemoglobin count is low. Clinicians use this same content equation to estimate whether a patient needs supplemental oxygen, a blood transfusion, or both — a decision that hinges on distinguishing *how saturated* the available hemoglobin is from *how much* hemoglobin is actually present.

## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a toxic condition in which inhaled CO binds to hemoglobin far more readily than oxygen does, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and sharply reducing the blood's capacity to deliver oxygen to tissues. CO is colorless, odorless, and produced by incomplete combustion — faulty furnaces, car exhaust in enclosed spaces, charcoal grills indoors, or gas generators. Because it gives no sensory warning, poisoning often progresses silently until symptoms (headache, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness) are already severe.

The chemistry explains the danger. Hemoglobin's affinity for CO is roughly 200–250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen. When CO occupies a binding site on hemoglobin, that site cannot carry oxygen, and the remaining oxygen-carrying sites also become more reluctant to release their oxygen to tissues — the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve shifts left. The net effect is a double insult: less oxygen picked up in the lungs, and less oxygen released where it's needed. A person can have a fatal COHb level while their skin remains a deceptively normal or even "cherry-red" color, because standard pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxyhemoglobin from carboxyhemoglobin.

**Worked example.** Suppose room air has a CO concentration high enough that, at equilibrium, a person's blood reaches 40% COHb (a level associated with confusion and risk of collapse). If total hemoglobin oxygen-carrying capacity is fixed, only 60% of binding sites remain available for oxygen. Even if those remaining sites are fully saturated with O$_2$, the blood's effective oxygen-carrying capacity is capped at 60% of normal — comparable to losing 40% of one's red blood cells instantaneously, but without the compensatory time the body would have for anemia.

**Problem-solving application.** Emergency responders use this same logic in reverse: administering 100% oxygen (versus ~21% in room air) sharply increases the partial pressure of O$_2$, which competes CO off hemoglobin faster, cutting the elimination half-life of COHb from roughly 4–5 hours in room air to about 1–1.5 hours. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy compresses this further by raising O$_2$ partial pressure even more. This principle — that treatment works by mass-action competition at the binding site, not by "flushing" CO out chemically — is why the first response to suspected CO poisoning is always removal from the source and immediate high-flow oxygen, not waiting for symptoms to clarify.

## Payoff

Carbon monoxide poisoning is where every earlier concept in this book — combustion chemistry, gas diffusion, hemoglobin binding, cellular respiration, and public-health risk assessment — converges into a single, high-stakes diagnostic and preventive problem. CO is dangerous precisely because it is odorless, colorless, and non-irritating: none of the human senses that normally warn us about combustion byproducts (smoke, sulfur odor, heat) fire in its presence. Understanding why requires tracing the same chain of reasoning built throughout the course: incomplete combustion produces CO as a molecule structurally similar to $\text{O}_2$; CO diffuses across the alveolar membrane by the same passive-diffusion principles as oxygen; and it binds hemoglobin roughly 200 to 250 times more tightly than oxygen does, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and starving tissues of usable oxygen even while blood oxygen partial pressure looks deceptively normal. This is the natural capstone because it forces the reader to synthesize chemistry, physiology, and quantitative risk in one applied judgment — exactly what the course has been building toward.

Each application domain draws directly on this synthesis. In *environmental and combustion engineering*, the concept motivates why furnaces, generators, and vehicle exhaust systems are designed and regulated around minimizing incomplete combustion. In *clinical medicine and toxicology*, the COHb-binding model explains why pulse oximetry can fail to detect CO poisoning (it cannot distinguish COHb from oxyhemoglobin) and why treatment relies on displacing CO with high-flow or hyperbaric oxygen. In *public health and building safety*, the same diffusion and exposure principles justify CO detector placement, ventilation codes, and exposure-limit standards. In *emergency response and risk communication*, understanding the silent, cumulative nature of CO exposure shapes how warnings and evacuation protocols are designed for a hazard people cannot perceive on their own.

From here, the most productive next step is to pick one domain and work it fully: for instance, take the clinical application and work through how COHb concentration, exposure duration, and altitude interact to determine poisoning severity, then use that model to evaluate a real safety scenario — a car left running in a closed garage, or a faulty furnace in a poorly ventilated home.
