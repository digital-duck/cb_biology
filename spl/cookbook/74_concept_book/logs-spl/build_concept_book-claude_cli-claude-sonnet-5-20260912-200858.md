## Macronutrients Micronutrients

Prokaryotes, like all organisms, must acquire chemical elements from their environment to build biomass and run metabolism. These elements fall into two categories based on the quantity required: macronutrients, needed in relatively large amounts, and micronutrients (also called trace elements), needed in only minute quantities. The distinction is not about importance — both are essential for growth — but about the scale at which the cell uses them.

Macronutrients include carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sodium. Carbon and nitrogen dominate this list because they are structural: carbon forms the backbone of every organic molecule (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates), while nitrogen is essential for amino acids and nucleotides. Phosphorus is required for ATP, phospholipids, and DNA/RNA, and sulfur is needed for certain amino acids (cysteine, methionine) and coenzymes. These elements are consumed in gram-per-liter quantities in a growth medium because they literally make up the bulk of dry cell mass — roughly half of a bacterium's dry weight is carbon.

Micronutrients — iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, and nickel among others — are required in microgram-per-liter or even nanogram-per-liter concentrations. Despite the tiny amounts, their absence can halt growth entirely, because they function as cofactors bound tightly to enzyme active sites. Iron, for example, is central to cytochromes in the electron transport chain; without it, a cell cannot generate ATP via respiration even if carbon and nitrogen are abundant.

This macro/micro distinction has direct practical application in microbiology and biotechnology. When formulating a growth medium — for a diagnostic culture, an industrial fermentation, or a wastewater bioreactor — a technician must supply macronutrients in bulk (e.g., glucose or another carbon source, ammonium or nitrate for nitrogen, phosphate buffers) and add a "trace element solution" containing micronutrient salts at very low concentration. Omitting a single trace metal, such as molybdenum in nitrogen-fixing bacteria (needed for the nitrogenase enzyme), can cause an otherwise well-fed culture to grow poorly or not at all — a diagnostic clue used routinely to troubleshoot failed cultures: if adding carbon and nitrogen doesn't restore growth, suspect a missing trace element.

## Prokaryote Metabolic Diversity

Every living cell needs two things: a source of energy and a source of carbon to build biomass. You already know two of the four possible combinations from eukaryotes: photoautotrophs (like plants, using light for energy and CO₂ for carbon) and heterotrophs (using organic molecules for both). Prokaryotes reveal that these two requirements — energy source and carbon source — are actually independent choices, not a fixed pair. That decoupling is the one new idea in this section, and it explains why bacteria and archaea occupy environments — deep-sea vents, acidic hot springs, anoxic mud, the human gut — that no eukaryote could survive in.

The energy axis is either light (photo-) or chemical bonds (chemo-). The carbon axis is either CO₂ fixed from the atmosphere (auto-) or organic compounds scavenged from the environment (hetero-). Once you allow these two axes to combine freely, you get a category eukaryotes never evolved: the chemoautotroph. A sulfur-oxidizing bacterium at a hydrothermal vent strips electrons from an inorganic molecule like H₂S to generate ATP, then uses that energy to fix CO₂ into biomass — no light required at all. This is why entire vent ecosystems can thrive in total darkness, a strategy unavailable to any plant or animal, and it is the key contrast to keep in mind: a chemoautotroph gets its energy the way an animal does (from chemical bonds) but builds its body the way a plant does (from CO₂).

Consider a worked example: a microbiologist samples water from a sulfide-rich cave and finds a bacterium growing in complete darkness with no organic carbon added to the medium. What is its most likely metabolic category? Since there is no light, energy must come from chemicals; since there is no organic carbon supplied, carbon must come from CO₂. The organism is a chemoautotroph, and the sulfide is the strongest candidate as its electron donor.

This framework has direct problem-solving value: given an environment's available energy and carbon sources, you can predict which metabolic strategy will dominate, and conversely, given an organism's growth requirements in culture, you can infer the chemistry of its natural habitat — a technique used in bioprospecting for industrial enzymes and in identifying unculturable microbes from environmental DNA alone.

## Energy And Carbon Source Classification

Every prokaryote must solve two separate problems: where does it get energy to power cellular work, and where does it get carbon to build its molecules? Biologists classify organisms along both axes independently, then combine the terms.

For energy, an organism is either a **phototroph** (captures light energy) or a **chemotroph** (extracts energy by breaking chemical bonds). For carbon, an organism is either an **autotroph** (builds organic molecules from inorganic CO₂) or a **heterotroph** (obtains carbon by consuming preformed organic molecules from other organisms). Combining one term from each axis gives four nutritional categories: photoautotroph, photoheterotroph, chemoautotroph, and chemoheterotroph.

**Worked example.** Consider three prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use sunlight to split water and fix CO₂ into sugars — that's photoautotroph, the same strategy as plants. *Nitrosomonas*, a soil bacterium, oxidizes ammonia (NH₃) for energy and fixes CO₂ for carbon — a chemoautotroph, since its energy source is chemical rather than light, but its carbon source is still inorganic. *E. coli* in your gut breaks down glucose both for energy and as a carbon skeleton — a chemoheterotroph, the category that includes most bacteria and all animals and fungi. The rarer photoheterotroph category includes purple non-sulfur bacteria, which use light for energy but scavenge organic acids like succinate for carbon — proof that the two axes really are independent.

**Applying the framework.** Given an unfamiliar organism, work through two yes/no questions in sequence: (1) Does it require light to grow, or does it grow equally well in the dark given a chemical substrate? This settles photo- vs. chemo-. (2) Does it grow on a minimal medium containing only CO₂, water, and mineral salts, or does it need an organic carbon compound like glucose or acetate added? This settles auto- vs. hetero-. For instance, if a newly isolated hot-spring microbe grows in total darkness on a medium containing only hydrogen sulfide, CO₂, and minerals, you can classify it: no light requirement rules out photo-, so it's chemo-; growth on CO₂ alone rules out heterotrophy, so it's autotrophic. Conclusion: chemoautotroph — likely a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, ecologically important in deep-sea hydrothermal vents where sunlight never reaches. This same two-question diagnostic is exactly how microbiologists screen environmental isolates in the lab before doing genetic identification.

## Nitrogen Cycle

Nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere, yet most organisms cannot use N₂ gas directly — the triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms is too stable to break without specialized enzymes. The nitrogen cycle describes how nitrogen moves between this unusable atmospheric pool and biologically available forms, a transformation carried out almost entirely by prokaryotes. Four processes drive the cycle: **nitrogen fixation** converts N₂ into ammonia (NH₃), performed by bacteria such as *Rhizobium* (living symbiotically in legume root nodules) and free-living cyanobacteria. **Nitrification** oxidizes ammonium (NH₄⁺) first to nitrite (NO₂⁻) by bacteria like *Nitrosomonas*, then to nitrate (NO₃⁻) by bacteria like *Nitrobacter*. **Ammonification** occurs when decomposers break down nitrogen-containing organic matter (proteins, nucleic acids) in dead organisms and waste, releasing ammonium back into the soil. **Denitrification** completes the loop, as bacteria such as *Pseudomonas* convert nitrate back into N₂ gas under anaerobic conditions, returning nitrogen to the atmosphere.

**Worked example.** A farmer notices that a field planted with soybeans (a legume) needs less synthetic fertilizer than an adjacent field of corn. Why? Soybean roots host *Rhizobium* bacteria in nodules that fix atmospheric N₂ into ammonia, which the plant converts to organic nitrogen compounds. When the soybean plants are later plowed under, ammonification releases this stored nitrogen as ammonium, and nitrification converts it into plant-available nitrate. Corn lacks this symbiotic relationship, so it depends on nitrogen already present in the soil or added as fertilizer.

**Applying the concept.** Suppose a wetland shows unexpectedly low nitrate levels despite high ammonium input from agricultural runoff. To diagnose this, you'd check for two competing possibilities: either nitrification is being blocked (e.g., by low oxygen, since *Nitrosomonas* and *Nitrobacter* require aerobic conditions), or nitrification is proceeding but denitrification is rapidly converting the resulting nitrate back to N₂ in the wetland's anaerobic sediments. This second scenario is actually exploited intentionally — engineers design constructed wetlands with alternating aerobic and anaerobic zones specifically to sequence nitrification and denitrification, using the nitrogen cycle itself to remove excess nitrogen from wastewater before it reaches downstream ecosystems.

## Biological Nitrogen Fixation

Nitrogen gas ($\text{N}_2$) makes up 78% of Earth's atmosphere, but plants and animals cannot use it directly. The triple bond holding the two nitrogen atoms together is extraordinarily stable, requiring enormous energy to break. Biological nitrogen fixation is the process by which certain prokaryotes — bacteria and archaea, never eukaryotes — convert atmospheric $\text{N}_2$ into ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), a form plants can absorb and build into amino acids, nucleotides, and chlorophyll. This capability is exclusive to prokaryotes because only they possess the enzyme nitrogenase, and it happens in two ecological modes: free-living bacteria (like *Azotobacter* in soil, or cyanobacteria in water) that fix nitrogen independently, and symbiotic bacteria (chiefly *Rhizobium*) that live inside root nodules of legumes such as soybeans, peas, and clover.

Consider a farmer managing two fields: one planted continuously with corn, the other rotated with soybeans every third year. Corn is a heavy nitrogen consumer and depletes soil nitrogen over successive seasons, forcing reliance on synthetic fertilizer. Soybean roots, by contrast, form nodules housing *Rhizobium*, which fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia in exchange for sugars from the plant — a mutualistic symbiosis. When soybean residue decomposes after harvest, the fixed nitrogen enriches the soil for the next crop. This is why crop rotation with legumes is a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture: it reduces fertilizer costs and reliance on the energy-intensive industrial Haber-Bosch process, which fixes nitrogen artificially but consumes roughly 1-2% of global energy output.

Applying this concept: suppose a plant biologist is designing a low-input farming system for a region without access to affordable fertilizer. The solution is not simply "add nitrogen" but to engineer the biological pathway — select legume cover crops compatible with local *Rhizobium* strains, intercrop legumes with cereals, or inoculate seeds with nitrogen-fixing bacterial cultures before planting. Evaluating such a system requires estimating nitrogen contribution per hectare from a given legume species, comparing it against the crop's nitrogen demand, and timing rotations so fixed nitrogen is available when the subsequent crop needs it most — turning a microbiological process into a practical agronomic strategy.

## Payoff

Biological nitrogen fixation is the process by which certain microorganisms convert atmospheric nitrogen gas ($\text{N}_2$) into ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), the form of nitrogen that living cells can actually use to build proteins, DNA, and other essential molecules. Nitrogen makes up nearly 80% of Earth's atmosphere, yet the triple bond holding $\text{N}_2$ together is so stable that most organisms cannot break it. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria — free-living species like *Azotobacter* and symbiotic species like *Rhizobium*, which colonizes the root nodules of legumes — possess the enzyme nitrogenase, capable of performing this conversion at ordinary temperatures and pressures, something industrial chemistry can only match using the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process (high heat, high pressure, and enormous fossil fuel input). This is the natural endpoint of a concept-book because it sits at the intersection of nearly every layer studied before it: microbiology, biochemistry, ecology, agriculture, and global environmental cycles all converge on this single reaction.

The reach of this concept extends outward through concrete applications. In sustainable agriculture, crop rotation and intercropping with legumes exploit *Rhizobium* symbiosis to replenish soil nitrogen without synthetic fertilizer, cutting both cost and the fossil fuel footprint of farming. In environmental science, biological nitrogen fixation anchors the global nitrogen cycle, explaining how nitrogen moves from the atmosphere into soil, plants, and eventually back out through decomposition and denitrification — a cycle whose disruption by fertilizer overuse drives problems like eutrophication and dead zones in waterways. In biotechnology, researchers are engineering nitrogenase genes into cereal crops like wheat and rice, which cannot naturally fix nitrogen, aiming to reduce global dependence on Haber-Bosch fertilizer and its associated carbon emissions. And in industrial and energy policy, understanding how nature accomplishes at room temperature what human engineering requires blast-furnace conditions to replicate motivates ongoing research into greener catalytic alternatives.

As an invitation to go deeper: consider tracing how a shift toward legume-based crop rotation in a specific agricultural region could reduce fertilizer runoff and its downstream effect on nearby water systems. Working through that single case — soil chemistry, farm economics, and watershed ecology together — turns the abstract reaction $\text{N}_2 + 8\text{H}^+ + 8e^- \rightarrow 2\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2$ into a lever you can actually reason about for solving a real-world problem.
