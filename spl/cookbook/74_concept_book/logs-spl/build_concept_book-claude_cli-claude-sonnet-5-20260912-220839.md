## Digestion

Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small organic molecules that cells can absorb and use — sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleotides. Mechanical digestion increases the surface area of food (chewing, churning in the stomach), while chemical digestion uses enzymes and acids to break covalent bonds in large polymers, converting starches into simple sugars, proteins into amino acids, and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. The two processes work together: mechanical breakdown exposes more surface area for enzymes to act on, dramatically speeding up the chemical reactions.

**Worked example.** Consider a bite of bread, which is mostly starch — a polymer of glucose units linked by glycosidic bonds. Digestion begins in the mouth, where salivary amylase starts hydrolyzing those bonds into shorter chains and maltose (a two-glucose sugar). In the stomach, acid and pepsin mainly target any proteins present, while starch digestion pauses because stomach acid inactivates amylase. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase resumes breaking down starch fragments into maltose, and enzymes anchored in the intestinal lining (maltase) cleave maltose into individual glucose molecules, small enough to cross into the bloodstream. This stepwise breakdown — polymer → oligomer → monomer — illustrates why digestion requires multiple specialized enzymes rather than one universal catalyst: each enzyme recognizes a specific bond geometry.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient is lactose intolerant, meaning their small intestine produces little or no lactase, the enzyme that splits lactose (a disaccharide of glucose and galactose) into its two monomers. Without lactase, lactose passes undigested into the large intestine, where bacteria ferment it, producing gas and drawing water into the colon by osmosis — causing bloating and diarrhea. Applying the digestion framework, you can predict two interventions: (1) supply the missing enzyme directly, as lactase pills do, allowing hydrolysis to occur before bacterial fermentation, or (2) avoid the substrate entirely by choosing lactose-free dairy, where the lactose has already been enzymatically pre-digested in production. This example shows the practical value of tracing a digestive pathway substrate by substrate: identifying exactly which bond fails to break tells you precisely where to intervene, whether through enzyme replacement, dietary modification, or predigestion.

## Enzyme

**Definition.** An enzyme is a protein that speeds up (catalyzes) a specific chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. In digestion, enzymes break the bonds holding large food macromolecules — starches, proteins, and fats — together, splitting them into smaller units small enough to cross the intestinal lining and enter the bloodstream. Each enzyme has an active site, a pocket shaped to fit only its target molecule (the substrate), much like a specific key fits a specific lock. This specificity means the body needs a different enzyme for each type of macromolecule: amylase for starch, proteases (like pepsin and trypsin) for protein, and lipases for fat.

**Worked example.** Consider a slice of bread sitting in your mouth. Saliva contains amylase, which binds to starch molecules — long chains of glucose units — and cleaves the bonds linking them, releasing shorter chains and eventually individual sugar units. If you chew the bread longer, you may notice it starts to taste faintly sweet; this is amylase converting starch into simpler sugars in real time. The reaction would occur without amylase, but at a negligible rate — enzymes typically increase reaction speed by factors of a million or more by lowering the activation energy required for the bond-breaking step, without changing the products formed.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient's stool sample shows undigested fat, and a doctor suspects a pancreatic enzyme deficiency. Which enzyme should be tested first, and why? Since fat digestion depends specifically on lipase (produced mainly by the pancreas), a clinician would check pancreatic lipase levels rather than amylase or protease, because enzyme specificity means each digestive problem points to a particular missing catalyst. This same logic applies broadly: lactose intolerance arises from insufficient lactase (needed to split lactose into glucose and galactose), and certain infant formulas are engineered around which enzymes a newborn's gut has not yet begun producing. Recognizing that enzymes are substrate-specific — not general-purpose digestive aids — lets you diagnose or design around a digestive bottleneck by asking "which macromolecule isn't being broken down, and which enzyme is responsible for that exact bond?"

## Sphincter

A sphincter is a ring-shaped band of muscle surrounding an opening or passage in the body, capable of contracting to close that opening or relaxing to allow material through. In the digestive tract, sphincters act as one-way valves stationed at key junctions between segments, regulating the timing and direction of movement so that food, chyme, and waste progress in a controlled sequence rather than flowing freely or backward.

**Worked example.** Consider the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), located where the esophagus meets the stomach. Normally, the LES stays contracted, sealing off the stomach's acidic contents from the esophagus. When a bolus of swallowed food arrives, a wave of peristalsis triggers the LES to relax briefly, letting the bolus pass into the stomach; it then re-contracts. This mechanism explains a common medical problem: if the LES weakens or relaxes inappropriately, stomach acid escapes upward into the esophagus, producing the burning sensation known as acid reflux or heartburn. The sphincter's job is not simply to be a fixed opening but a *regulated* valve — its state (contracted vs. relaxed) changes in response to signals like the arrival of a food bolus, hormonal cues, or the volume of material in the segment behind it.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient reports that food seems to "get stuck" and regurgitate rather than pass into the stomach, with no reflux symptoms. Applying the concept of sphincter function, you would reason through the mechanism: the LES may be failing to relax during swallowing, keeping the esophagus-stomach junction closed even after a peristaltic wave arrives. This condition, called achalasia, illustrates how a sphincter dysfunctioning in one direction (failure to open) produces a very different clinical picture than dysfunction in the other direction (failure to close, as in reflux). This kind of diagnostic reasoning generalizes across the digestive tract: the pyloric sphincter (stomach to small intestine) and the ileocecal sphincter (small to large intestine) each perform the same basic role — timed, one-way gatekeeping — and dysfunction at any of these sites can be predicted and interpreted using the same logic of contraction, relaxation, and directional control, rather than memorizing each valve as an isolated fact.

## Stomach

**Definition**

The stomach is a muscular, saclike organ that receives food from the esophagus and continues digestion through both mechanical and chemical means. Its inner lining contains gastric glands that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl), pepsinogen, and mucus. The HCl lowers the stomach's internal pH to roughly 1.5–3.5, an environment acidic enough to kill most ingested bacteria and to convert pepsinogen into its active form, pepsin. Pepsin is a protease — an enzyme that breaks peptide bonds in proteins, cleaving long polypeptide chains into shorter fragments. Meanwhile, rhythmic contractions of the stomach wall (peristalsis) churn the food, mixing it with these secretions until it becomes a thick, semi-liquid mass called chyme, which is then released in controlled amounts into the small intestine.

**Worked example**

Consider a meal containing a chicken breast (protein), rice (starch), and butter (fat). Once this reaches the stomach, HCl denatures the proteins in the chicken — unfolding their three-dimensional structure so that pepsin's active site can access internal peptide bonds. Pepsin then breaks these bonds, cleaving the protein into shorter peptide chains (not yet free amino acids — that final step occurs in the small intestine). Starch digestion, started by salivary amylase in the mouth, actually halts in the stomach, because the acidic pH denatures amylase. Fat digestion is likewise minimal here, since the stomach lacks significant lipase activity and fats aren't broken into smaller droplets until bile is added downstream. This illustrates a key point: the stomach specializes almost exclusively in initiating protein digestion, while carbohydrate and fat processing are deferred to other organs better suited to those tasks.

**Problem-solving application**

Suppose a patient is prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a drug that suppresses gastric acid secretion, to treat chronic acid reflux. Predict two downstream effects on digestion. First, with less HCl, pepsinogen is converted to pepsin less efficiently, impairing protein breakdown in the stomach. Second, reduced acidity weakens the stomach's antimicrobial barrier, potentially allowing more ingested pathogens to survive passage. This kind of reasoning — tracing how a change in one variable (acid concentration) propagates through a linked chemical and biological system — is the core skill for analyzing digestive physiology and predicting the effects of disease or medication on nutrient processing.

## Ulcers

The stomach lining is coated in a thick layer of mucus that shields the tissue beneath from hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes strong enough to break down food. A peptic ulcer forms when this protective layer is breached, exposing the underlying lining to acid, which erodes it and creates an open sore. The dominant cause, identified in the 1980s, is infection by the bacterium *Helicobacter pylori*, which burrows into the mucus layer and weakens it; long-term use of NSAIDs (like ibuprofen or aspirin) can do the same by suppressing the prostaglandins that stimulate mucus production. Ulcers can occur in the stomach (gastric ulcers) or the upper small intestine (duodenal ulcers).

**Worked example.** Suppose a patient reports burning stomach pain that worsens between meals and improves after eating, along with occasional dark, tarry stools. The pain pattern (relief with food, which buffers acid) and the dark stool (indicating digested blood) point toward a duodenal ulcer with slow bleeding rather than, say, a simple case of heartburn. A physician would test for *H. pylori* — via a breath test, stool antigen test, or biopsy during endoscopy — before deciding on treatment, since an infection-driven ulcer requires antibiotics, whereas an NSAID-driven ulcer requires stopping the drug and using acid-suppressing medication instead.

**Problem-solving application.** This is where clinical reasoning becomes a genuine diagnostic puzzle: two patients can present nearly identical symptoms but require entirely different treatments depending on the underlying cause. If a patient tests negative for *H. pylori* but has been taking daily aspirin for a heart condition, prescribing antibiotics would be pointless — the correct intervention is to switch to acid-reducing therapy (such as a proton pump inhibitor) and reassess whether the aspirin regimen can be modified. Conversely, treating an *H. pylori* infection with acid suppression alone, without antibiotics, allows the bacteria to persist and the ulcer to recur. This illustrates a broader principle in medicine: identical symptoms can arise from mechanistically distinct causes, so effective treatment depends on first correctly diagnosing which barrier — biological or chemical — was actually broken.
