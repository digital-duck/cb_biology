## Blood Composition

Blood is a connective tissue made of a liquid matrix, plasma, in which formed cellular elements are suspended. In a healthy adult, blood separates by composition into roughly 55% plasma and 45% cells and cell fragments — a ratio you can literally see by spinning a blood sample in a centrifuge, which pushes the denser cellular material to the bottom of the tube.

Plasma is about 90% water, with the remaining 10% consisting of proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen), electrolytes, nutrients, hormones, and waste products dissolved or suspended in it. The cellular fraction is dominated by red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen via hemoglobin; white blood cells (leukocytes), which defend against infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which enable clotting. Red blood cells vastly outnumber the other two cell types, so the volume percentage of red blood cells specifically — called the hematocrit — closely tracks the total cellular percentage.

**Worked example.** A patient's blood sample of 5.0 mL is centrifuged. The plasma layer measures 2.75 mL. What is the hematocrit (the percent of blood volume occupied by red blood cells and other formed elements)? Since plasma and cells account for the entire sample, the cellular fraction is $5.0 - 2.75 = 2.25$ mL, giving a hematocrit of $\frac{2.25}{5.0} \times 100\% = 45\%$ — consistent with the typical human ratio.

**Problem-solving application.** Hematocrit is a standard clinical measurement, and physicians use deviations from the ~45% norm as diagnostic clues rather than isolated numbers. A hematocrit below the normal range (roughly 38–48% depending on sex and age) suggests anemia — too few red blood cells or too little hemoglobin, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. A hematocrit above the normal range suggests polycythemia, which can occur from dehydration (less plasma, same red cell count, so the *ratio* rises even though absolute red cell count hasn't changed) or from genuine overproduction of red blood cells (as seen in people acclimating to high altitude, where the body increases red cell production to compensate for lower oxygen availability). Distinguishing these two causes — a plasma-volume problem versus a cell-count problem — is a core diagnostic skill, and it depends entirely on understanding that hematocrit is a ratio of two independently variable quantities, not a fixed biological constant.

## Hemoglobin Respiratory Pigments

Respiratory pigments are specialized proteins that bind oxygen reversibly, allowing organisms to load $O_2$ where it is abundant (the lungs or gills) and release it where it is scarce (respiring tissues). Hemoglobin, the pigment used by vertebrates and many invertebrates, consists of four polypeptide subunits, each cradling a heme group — a ring-shaped organic molecule with an iron ($Fe^{2+}$) ion at its center. The iron atom is the actual oxygen-binding site: each heme can bind one $O_2$ molecule, so one hemoglobin molecule carries up to four. Hemoglobin also assists carbon dioxide transport, though most $CO_2$ travels dissolved as bicarbonate ion rather than bound directly to iron.

Not all organisms use iron-based hemoglobin. Many mollusks and arthropods (e.g., octopuses, lobsters) use hemocyanin, which relies on copper ions and turns blue, not red, when oxygenated. Some marine polychaete worms use chlorocruorin, an iron-based pigment chemically similar to hemoglobin but with a slightly altered heme structure that gives it a green tint at low concentration. Certain marine worms (sipunculids) use hemerythrin, an iron-containing but non-heme protein — the iron sits in a different molecular scaffold, and the pigment appears violet-pink when oxygenated. These alternatives illustrate convergent evolution: different lineages solved the same problem — reversible, high-capacity $O_2$ binding — using different metal chemistry and protein architecture.

**Worked example.** Suppose you're comparing two animals: one with hemoglobin (4 oxygen-binding sites per molecule) and one with hemocyanin (which, in many species, is dissolved directly in the blood plasma rather than packaged into cells and binds $O_2$ at a lower ratio, often one $O_2$ per two copper atoms). If a diver needs a rapid, high-volume oxygen delivery system for active muscle tissue, hemoglobin packaged in red blood cells is more efficient, because concentrating the pigment inside cells avoids raising blood viscosity while still achieving high $O_2$-carrying capacity.

**Applying the concept.** When identifying an unknown respiratory pigment in a lab sample, three observations help pinpoint identity: (1) the color change upon oxygenation (red for hemoglobin, blue for hemocyanin, green for chlorocruorin, violet-pink for hemerythrin), (2) the presence or absence of iron versus copper via a chemical assay, and (3) whether the pigment is confined to cells or dissolved freely in the circulatory fluid — a clue to how the organism balances oxygen capacity against blood viscosity.

## Red Blood Cells

A red blood cell (erythrocyte) is a small, biconcave, disk-shaped cell that lacks a nucleus in its mature form and is packed with hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein responsible for transporting oxygen. In humans, red blood cells account for roughly 40–45% of blood volume (a proportion called hematocrit) and number about 4.5–5.5 million per microliter of blood. Their defining structural feature — the biconcave shape — increases surface area relative to volume, which speeds the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the cell membrane and allows the cell to bend and squeeze through capillaries narrower than its own resting diameter.

**Worked example.** Consider why the loss of the nucleus and mitochondria during red blood cell maturation is functionally advantageous. Without a nucleus, the cell has more internal space for hemoglobin — each cell carries about 270 million hemoglobin molecules, and each hemoglobin molecule binds up to four oxygen molecules. Without mitochondria, the cell generates ATP anaerobically (through glycolysis), which means it does not consume the oxygen it is transporting. This is a clean illustration of structure-function trade-offs in biology: the cell sacrifices normal reproductive and protein-synthesis machinery in exchange for maximizing its single specialized task, oxygen delivery.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient's hematocrit drops from 45% to 30%, and hemoglobin concentration falls proportionally from 15 g/dL to 10 g/dL. Since oxygen-carrying capacity depends directly on hemoglobin concentration (each gram of hemoglobin can bind about 1.34 mL of oxygen), the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity falls from roughly \(15 \times 1.34 \approx 20.1\) mL O\(_2\)/dL to \(10 \times 1.34 \approx 13.4\) mL O\(_2\)/dL — a drop of about one-third, consistent with anemia. Clinicians use this relationship in reverse: given a target oxygen delivery rate and a patient's cardiac output, they can estimate the minimum hemoglobin concentration needed to sustain adequate tissue oxygenation, which is exactly the calculation behind decisions about when a transfusion is medically necessary. This links a cellular structural feature directly to a quantitative clinical decision.

## Blood Type Groups

Blood type is a classification based on the presence or absence of specific antigens—molecules that trigger an immune response—on the surface of red blood cells. The two clinically dominant systems are ABO and Rh. The ABO system defines four types: A (A-antigen present), B (B-antigen present), AB (both present), and O (neither present). The Rh system adds a fifth variable, the RhD antigen, giving each type a positive or negative designation (e.g., A+, O−). Combined, this yields eight common blood types.

Antigens matter because the immune system produces antibodies against antigens it doesn't recognize as "self." A person with type A blood carries anti-B antibodies in their plasma; a person with type B carries anti-A antibodies; type O carries both; type AB carries neither. If incompatible blood is transfused, the recipient's antibodies attack the donor's red cells, causing agglutination (clumping) and potentially fatal hemolytic reactions.

Consider a worked example. A patient with type B− blood needs an emergency transfusion. Which donor types are safe? The rule is: a donor's antigens must not trigger the recipient's antibodies. Type B− has anti-A antibodies and lacks the Rh antigen, so it will reject any blood containing A-antigens or RhD-antigen. Safe donors are B− and O− (both lack A-antigens; both lack RhD). Donating type B+ or A-containing blood would cause a reaction. This is why O− is called the "universal donor"—it lacks both A/B antigens and RhD, so no recipient's antibodies attack it—while AB+ is the "universal recipient," since it has no anti-A, anti-B, or anti-RhD antibodies to react against incoming blood.

For problem-solving practice, treat compatibility as a directed matching problem: list a patient's antigens, determine which antibodies they carry (the complement of their antigens within the ABO system), and then filter potential donors by excluding any whose red cells carry an antigen matching one of the recipient's antibodies. Hospitals use exactly this logic, encoded in compatibility charts, to select donors when exact type matches aren't available—critical in trauma care, blood bank inventory management, and prenatal care, where Rh incompatibility between mother and fetus requires monitoring and, when needed, medical intervention.

## Payoff

Blood type groups classify every person's red blood cells by the antigens on their surface — chiefly the ABO system (types A, B, AB, O) and the Rh factor (positive or negative). This single classification scheme is the natural endpoint of the book because it converts an invisible cellular property into an actionable rule: it tells clinicians, in advance, whose blood can safely mix with whose. That predictive power — turning biology into a decision procedure — is what every earlier concept in this text was building toward, whether the reader arrived through immunology, inheritance patterns, or population statistics.

Worked example: a patient with type O-negative blood is called the "universal donor" because O cells carry neither A nor B antigens and no Rh antigen, so no recipient's immune system will recognize them as foreign. Conversely, a patient with type AB-positive blood is the "universal recipient," since their immune system already tolerates A, B, and Rh antigens and will not reject any incoming type. A transfusion nurse consults a compatibility chart before every transfusion — that chart is nothing more than blood type groups applied as a lookup table, and it is the reason mismatched transfusions, once fatal, are now rare.

The concept connects outward wherever classification must guide a decision under biological risk. In transfusion medicine, it sets donor-recipient matching rules. In genetics, ABO and Rh inheritance (governed by simple dominant/recessive and codominant allele rules) lets you predict a child's possible blood type from the parents', and explains conditions like Rh incompatibility in pregnancy. In blood bank logistics, population frequencies of each type drive inventory and donor-recruitment planning, since O-negative is both universally useful and rare. In forensic science, blood typing was the original biological fingerprint, used to include or exclude suspects before DNA analysis existed. In epidemiology, type distributions correlate with susceptibility to certain diseases, informing public health research.

As a next step, pick one of these threads — genetics, blood banking, forensics, or epidemiology — and work through how blood type groups get applied there in practice: what data is collected, what rule is used, and what decision it ultimately supports. That exercise will show you the concept not as a biology fact to memorize, but as a working tool.
