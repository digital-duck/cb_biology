## Lung Volume

Lung volume refers to the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs during a single, distinct phase of breathing. Unlike lung *capacity*, which is the sum of two or more volumes, each lung volume is a discrete, non-overlapping quantity. Pulmonologists recognize four standard volumes: tidal volume (air moved in a normal, quiet breath), inspiratory reserve volume (extra air that can be forcibly inhaled after a normal inhalation), expiratory reserve volume (extra air that can be forcibly exhaled after a normal exhalation), and residual volume (air that remains in the lungs even after maximal exhalation, preventing alveolar collapse). Volumes are measured in liters or milliliters and typically assessed using a spirometer, a device that records the volume and rate of air movement over time.

**Worked example.** Consider a healthy adult with the following measured volumes: tidal volume (TV) = 0.5 L, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) = 3.0 L, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = 1.1 L, and residual volume (RV) = 1.2 L. A spirometer trace shows breathing cycling steadily at TV, then a deep forced inhalation adds the IRV on top of the last normal inhalation. To find the vital capacity — the maximum air a person can exhale after maximal inhalation — sum the three volumes a spirometer can actually measure: $VC = TV + IRV + ERV = 0.5 + 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.6\text{ L}$. Residual volume is excluded because it cannot be exhaled, and standard spirometry cannot measure it directly; it requires specialized techniques like helium dilution or body plethysmography.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient's total lung capacity (TLC), measured by plethysmography, is 6.0 L, and their vital capacity from spirometry is 4.4 L. Since $TLC = VC + RV$, the residual volume can be inferred without direct measurement: $RV = TLC - VC = 6.0 - 4.4 = 1.6\text{ L}$. This kind of reasoning — using measurable volumes to back out an unmeasurable one — is exactly how clinicians screen for conditions like emphysema, where trapped air raises RV, or restrictive diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, where nearly all volumes shrink. Interpreting a spirometry report is fundamentally an exercise in comparing a patient's measured volumes against age-, sex-, and height-adjusted reference values to flag abnormal patterns.

## Lung Capacity

Lung volumes describe discrete quantities of air a lung can hold or move under specific conditions. Lung capacities combine two or more of these volumes to describe functionally meaningful states of the respiratory system. The four standard capacities are: **inspiratory capacity** (tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume), the maximum air inhaled after a normal exhale; **functional residual capacity** (expiratory reserve volume + residual volume), the air remaining after a normal exhale; **vital capacity** (tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume + expiratory reserve volume), the maximum air that can be forcibly exhaled after a maximal inhale; and **total lung capacity** (vital capacity + residual volume), the absolute maximum air the lungs can hold.

**Worked example.** Suppose a patient's spirometry test reports: tidal volume (TV) = 500 mL, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) = 3,000 mL, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = 1,100 mL, and residual volume (RV) = 1,200 mL. Vital capacity is $VC = TV + IRV + ERV = 500 + 3{,}000 + 1{,}100 = 4{,}600$ mL. Total lung capacity is $TLC = VC + RV = 4{,}600 + 1{,}200 = 5{,}800$ mL. Note that residual volume cannot be measured by spirometry alone, since it is air that never leaves the lungs; it requires techniques like helium dilution or body plethysmography, so any capacity that includes RV (functional residual capacity, total lung capacity) depends on that supplementary measurement.

**Problem-solving application.** Clinicians use capacities, not raw volumes, to diagnose disease patterns because capacities isolate functionally relevant air pools. A reduced vital capacity with a normal or increased residual volume suggests an *obstructive* pattern (e.g., emphysema), where air is trapped and cannot be exhaled — RV rises, inflating both FRC and TLC even as VC shrinks. A reduced vital capacity accompanied by a reduced total lung capacity instead suggests a *restrictive* pattern (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), where the lung's overall expandability is limited, so every compartment shrinks together. Given a patient's TV, IRV, ERV, and RV, you can compute all four capacities and classify the likely pattern: check whether $TLC$ is elevated (obstructive) or diminished (restrictive) relative to a normal range (roughly 5–6 L for an adult), and cross-check by comparing VC against TLC to isolate whether the deficit originates in reserve volumes or in RV itself.

## Spirometry

Spirometry is the standard clinical technique for measuring how much air a person moves into and out of their lungs, and how quickly. A patient breathes through a mouthpiece connected to a spirometer, which records airflow or volume over time as a spirogram. From this single trace, clinicians extract several key quantities: tidal volume (the air moved in a normal, relaxed breath), vital capacity (the maximum air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation), and forced expiratory volume in one second, or $FEV_1$ (how much air a person can forcefully blow out in the first second of a maximal exhalation). The ratio $FEV_1/FVC$, where $FVC$ is forced vital capacity, is the single most useful number in the test, because it distinguishes two fundamentally different kinds of lung disease.

Consider a patient who exhales a total of 4.0 liters (their $FVC$) and manages to push out 3.6 liters of that within the first second. Their $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio is $3.6/4.0 = 0.90$, or 90%. This is normal — healthy adults typically clear at least 70–80% of their vital capacity in the first second, because healthy airways offer little resistance to fast airflow. Now consider a patient with the same $FVC$ of 4.0 liters but an $FEV_1$ of only 2.0 liters, giving a ratio of 50%. This pattern — reduced airflow despite largely preserved total volume — is the hallmark of an obstructive disease such as asthma or COPD, where narrowed or collapsing airways slow exhalation even though the lungs can still hold a normal amount of air.

Spirometry becomes a genuine problem-solving tool once you compare it against a restrictive pattern. A patient with pulmonary fibrosis might have both $FVC$ and $FEV_1$ reduced proportionally — say $FVC = 2.5$ L and $FEV_1 = 2.1$ L, giving a ratio of 84%, even higher than normal. Here the lungs are stiff and simply cannot expand to a normal volume, but airflow through open airways remains fast. A physician reading these two numbers together — total volume and the fraction expelled quickly — can classify a patient's disease as obstructive, restrictive, or normal before ordering further imaging, illustrating how a simple ratio derived from a breathing test encodes real diagnostic information.

## Fev1 Fvc Ratio

**Definition.** Spirometry measures how much air a person can move and how fast. Two quantities from this test define the FEV1/FVC ratio: forced vital capacity (FVC) is the total volume of air a person can forcibly exhale after a maximal inhalation, and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is the fraction of that total exhaled during just the first second. The ratio is

$$
\text{FEV1/FVC} = \frac{\text{volume exhaled in 1 second}}{\text{total volume exhaled}}
$$

expressed as a percentage. In healthy adults this ratio typically falls between 70% and 80%: most of the air leaves the lungs quickly because healthy airways offer little resistance. The ratio is diagnostically powerful because it separates two very different failure modes of the lungs — obstructive disease, where airways are narrowed or airflow is impeded (asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis), and restrictive disease, where the lungs themselves cannot expand fully (pulmonary fibrosis, chest wall deformities, some neuromuscular disorders).

**Worked example.** Suppose a patient's spirometry shows FEV1 = 1.8 L and FVC = 3.6 L. The ratio is $1.8/3.6 = 0.50$, or 50% — well below the 70% threshold. Because FVC (3.6 L) is close to normal but FEV1 is disproportionately low, the airways are obstructing airflow even though the lungs can still hold a near-normal volume of air. This pattern — low ratio, low FEV1, roughly preserved FVC — is the signature of obstructive disease such as COPD.

Contrast this with a second patient: FEV1 = 1.6 L, FVC = 2.0 L, giving a ratio of $1.6/2.0 = 0.80$, or 80% — normal or even high. Here both numbers are reduced from expected values, but proportionally, so the ratio stays intact. This pattern indicates restrictive disease: the lung volume itself is diminished (stiff, scarred, or compressed lungs), but whatever air is inhaled still exits quickly because the airways themselves are unobstructed.

**Problem-solving application.** Clinicians use this ratio as a first-pass triage tool before ordering more expensive imaging or lung-volume studies. Given a patient with FEV1 = 2.1 L and FVC = 2.5 L, compute the ratio ($2.1/2.5 = 0.84$, normal-to-high) and determine whether further testing should investigate restrictive causes (if FVC itself is below the predicted normal for the patient's age, sex, and height) or whether the results are simply healthy. The ratio alone doesn't diagnose disease — it directs which follow-up test to order next.

## Payoff

The $\text{FEV}_1/\text{FVC}$ ratio is the single number that turns two raw spirometry measurements into a diagnosis. On its own, $\text{FEV}_1$ (air forcibly exhaled in one second) tells you how fast someone can empty their lungs, and $\text{FVC}$ (total forced vital capacity) tells you how much air they can hold and expel. Neither number alone distinguishes a small person with healthy lungs from a large person with early airway disease — both effects, body size and lung health, are tangled up in the raw volumes. Dividing $\text{FEV}_1$ by $\text{FVC}$ cancels out the size-dependent scale of both quantities, leaving a dimensionless proportion that reflects only how *efficiently* air moves out of the lungs. A ratio below roughly $0.70$ signals obstruction — the airways are narrowed, as in asthma or COPD — while a low $\text{FVC}$ with a preserved or elevated ratio signals restriction, as in pulmonary fibrosis. This is the natural endpoint of the chapter because it is where every earlier tool — unit normalization, ratio construction, threshold reasoning, and reference-population comparison — converges into a single clinical decision rule.

That convergence is exactly what makes the ratio the springboard into its applications. In pulmonary function testing, it is the frontline metric a physician reads first, before ordering imaging or further tests. In epidemiological screening, the same ratio, applied to age- and height-adjusted reference equations, lets clinics flag undiagnosed COPD in smokers years before symptoms become disabling. In occupational health, tracking an individual's ratio over repeated annual exams reveals slow airway damage from dust or chemical exposure long before a single measurement would look abnormal. In sports and exercise physiology, a normal or high ratio confirms that a reduced $\text{FVC}$ in an athlete reflects conditioning rather than disease. Each of these domains reuses the identical construction: normalize two measurements against each other, then judge the result against an established threshold or trend.

Pick one of these domains — clinical diagnosis, population screening, occupational surveillance, or athletic assessment — and work through how the same ratio, interpreted against a different reference population, changes the decision it supports.
