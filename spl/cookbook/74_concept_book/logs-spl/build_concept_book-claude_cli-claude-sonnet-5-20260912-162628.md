## Atom

An **atom** is the smallest unit of an element that retains that element's chemical identity. Atoms are the building blocks of all ordinary matter — every solid, liquid, and gas you encounter is made of atoms bonded together or moving freely. Each atom consists of a dense, positively charged **nucleus** (containing protons and neutrons) surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged **electrons**. The number of protons in the nucleus is the **atomic number** ($Z$), which uniquely identifies the element. A neutral atom has exactly as many electrons as protons. The **mass number** ($A$) equals the total count of protons and neutrons: $A = Z + N$, where $N$ is the number of neutrons.

**Worked example.** A neutral atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. Identify the element, write its symbol, and determine how many electrons it has.

- $Z = 17$ → element is **Chlorine (Cl)**
- $A = 17 + 18 = 35$ → symbol: $^{35}_{17}\text{Cl}$
- Neutral atom: electrons $= Z = 17$

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are given a mystery atom with mass number 23 and 12 neutrons. Find $Z$, identify the element, and predict whether it is likely to gain or lose electrons in a chemical reaction.

Step 1: $Z = A - N = 23 - 12 = 11$ → **Sodium (Na)**  
Step 2: Sodium sits in Group 1 of the periodic table, meaning it has 1 valence electron. Atoms seek a stable octet; losing that single electron costs far less energy than gaining seven. Sodium therefore **loses 1 electron** to form $\text{Na}^+$.

This reasoning — atomic number gives identity, valence electron count predicts reactivity — is the core skill. Every chemical equation, every material property, and every biological molecule ultimately traces back to how individual atoms are structured and how they interact.

## Electron

An electron is a subatomic particle carrying a single unit of negative electric charge, approximately $-1.602 \times 10^{-19}\text{ C}$, and a mass of about $9.109 \times 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$ — roughly 1/1836 the mass of a proton. Electrons occupy the space around an atomic nucleus, and their arrangement determines nearly every chemical and electrical property of matter: how atoms bond, how materials conduct electricity, and how light interacts with substances. Unlike a planet orbiting the sun, an electron does not follow a fixed path; quantum mechanics describes its location only probabilistically, in terms of regions called orbitals where it is likely to be found.

**Worked example.** Consider a neutral carbon atom, atomic number 6, meaning it has 6 protons and therefore 6 electrons. These electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy: 2 electrons occupy the innermost shell, and the remaining 4 occupy the second shell. This second-shell arrangement of 4 electrons — not enough to fill the shell, but more than half full — is exactly why carbon can form four bonds with other atoms, making it the backbone of organic chemistry. Contrast this with neon (atomic number 10), whose second shell is completely full with 8 electrons, leaving it chemically inert. The number of outer, or "valence," electrons is the single most predictive fact about how an element behaves.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are asked to predict whether magnesium (atomic number 12) will tend to lose or gain electrons when forming a compound. Its electron arrangement is 2, 8, 2 — two electrons sit alone in the outermost shell. Removing those two is easier than acquiring six more to fill the shell, so magnesium loses them, forming a $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion. This same reasoning — count the valence electrons, then judge whether losing or gaining fewer electrons gets the atom to a full outer shell — lets you predict the charge and reactivity of almost any element on the periodic table, and explains why table salt forms as $\text{Na}^+\text{Cl}^-$ rather than some other combination. This predictive power is what makes the electron, despite its tiny mass, central to chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering alike.

## Electron Orbital

An electron orbital is a mathematical description of the region around an atomic nucleus where an electron has a high probability of being found. Unlike the fixed circular paths in early atomic models, an orbital is derived from solving the Schrödinger equation for an electron bound to a nucleus. The solution, called a wave function $\psi$, does not tell you exactly where the electron is at any instant — quantum mechanics forbids that kind of certainty. Instead, $|\psi|^2$ gives the *probability density*: the likelihood of detecting the electron in a small volume of space. An orbital is the three-dimensional shape enclosing the region where that probability is high, typically drawn to contain about 90% of the electron's likely location.

Each orbital is labeled by quantum numbers that determine its size, shape, and orientation. The $s$ orbitals are spherical; $p$ orbitals have two lobes on either side of the nucleus; $d$ and $f$ orbitals have more complex, multi-lobed shapes. These shapes are not arbitrary — they emerge directly from the mathematics of standing waves confined near a nucleus, similar to how a vibrating drumhead produces specific standing-wave patterns rather than random shapes.

**Worked example.** Consider the hydrogen atom's $1s$ orbital, the lowest-energy solution. Its probability density is highest very close to the nucleus and decreases smoothly outward, with no directional preference — hence the spherical shape. If a chemist wants to predict whether hydrogen will bond with another atom, they examine where this spherical electron density overlaps with the orbital of the approaching atom; bonding orbitals form where these regions constructively overlap.

**Problem-solving application.** Orbital shapes and energies explain the structure of the periodic table and predict chemical behavior. For instance, to determine why carbon forms four bonds rather than two, chemists apply orbital hybridization: carbon's $2s$ and three $2p$ orbitals mix to form four equivalent $sp^3$ orbitals, each capable of pairing with another atom's electron. This reasoning — starting from orbital shape and energy, then predicting bonding capacity — is the standard problem-solving approach in introductory chemistry for explaining molecular geometry, reactivity, and bond strength across the periodic table.

## Electron Shell

The electron shell model describes electrons as occupying discrete energy levels, or shells, at characteristic distances from the nucleus, rather than orbiting at arbitrary radii. Each shell is labeled by a principal quantum number $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, with $n=1$ closest to the nucleus and lowest in energy. Electrons can only exist in these fixed levels — never between them — a direct consequence of quantum mechanics, where bound electrons occupy quantized energy states. The maximum number of electrons a shell can hold is given by $2n^2$: shell 1 holds up to 2, shell 2 up to 8, shell 3 up to 18, and so on. Electrons fill lower shells before occupying higher ones, and an atom's outermost shell — the valence shell — determines nearly all of its chemical behavior, since it is the electrons there that are gained, lost, or shared in bonding.

Consider sodium (atomic number 11). Its electrons fill shells according to $2n^2$, giving a configuration of 2, 8, 1. The first shell fills with 2, the second with 8 (its maximum), leaving 1 electron in the third shell. That lone valence electron makes sodium highly reactive: it readily loses this electron to achieve a stable, filled outer shell, which is exactly why sodium forms a $+1$ ion in compounds like NaCl.

This model becomes a genuine problem-solving tool when predicting reactivity and bonding patterns. Suppose you are given chlorine (atomic number 17) and asked to predict how it will bond. Filling shells in order: 2, 8, 7. The outer shell has 7 electrons, one short of a filled 8-electron shell. Rather than losing 7 electrons, chlorine will preferentially gain 1 electron, forming a $-1$ ion — which is why it pairs naturally with sodium's donated electron in NaCl. More generally, elements with 1–3 valence electrons tend to lose them (forming metals and cations), those with 5–7 tend to gain electrons (forming nonmetals and anions), and those with a full valence shell (like neon, with configuration 2, 8) are chemically inert. Given only an atomic number, you can now determine shell filling, identify the valence electron count, and predict both the ionic charge an atom will adopt and its general reactivity — turning a simple counting rule into a working model of chemical behavior.

## Electron Configuration

**Definition.** An electron configuration is a shorthand notation describing how electrons are distributed among an atom's orbitals. Electrons fill orbitals according to three governing rules: the **Aufbau principle** (electrons occupy the lowest-energy orbitals available first), the **Pauli exclusion principle** (each orbital holds at most two electrons, with opposite spins), and **Hund's rule** (electrons fill degenerate orbitals — orbitals of equal energy, like the three $p$ orbitals — singly before pairing up). Orbitals are labeled by principal quantum number $n$ and subshell type ($s$, $p$, $d$, $f$), with maximum electron capacities of 2, 6, 10, and 14 respectively. The filling order follows increasing $(n + \ell)$, summarized by the diagonal rule: $1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, \dots$

**Worked example.** Consider iron, $Z = 26$. Filling orbitals in order and tracking the electron count: $1s^2$ (2), $2s^2$ (4), $2p^6$ (10), $3s^2$ (12), $3p^6$ (18), $4s^2$ (20), $3d^6$ (26). The full configuration is:
$$1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^6\,3s^2\,3p^6\,4s^2\,3d^6$$
Note that $4s$ fills before $3d$ despite $3d$ belonging to a lower principal shell — this is because $4s$ has lower energy in neutral atoms at this point in the periodic table. A common shorthand uses the previous noble gas as a core: $[\text{Ar}]\,4s^2 3d^6$.

**Problem-solving application.** Electron configurations let you predict chemical behavior directly from an atom's position on the periodic table, without memorizing individual elements. Two skills matter most in practice:

1. *Predicting reactivity and ion charge.* Atoms tend toward configurations that fill or empty their outermost (valence) subshell. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) is one electron short of a filled $3p^6$ shell, so it readily gains an electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$. Magnesium ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2$) loses its two valence electrons to form $\text{Mg}^{2+}$, achieving the neon configuration.

2. *Handling exceptions.* Some transition metals deviate from the diagonal rule because half-filled or fully-filled $d$ subshells are unusually stable. Chromium is $[\text{Ar}]4s^1 3d^5$ rather than the "expected" $4s^2 3d^4$, since a half-filled $3d^5$ lowers overall energy through reduced electron-electron repulsion.

When solving configuration problems, always cross-check your electron count against $Z$, and for ions, remove or add electrons from the *outermost* shell first — even when that means removing $4s$ electrons before $3d$ electrons, since $3d$ becomes lower in energy than $4s$ once occupied.

## Valence Shell

The valence shell is the outermost occupied electron shell of an atom — the region farthest from the nucleus that still holds electrons. Electrons in this shell are called valence electrons, and they are the ones directly involved in forming chemical bonds. Inner-shell ("core") electrons are held tightly by the nucleus and rarely participate in bonding, while valence electrons are more loosely bound and more exposed, making them the atom's "handshake" with the outside world.

The number of valence electrons is what largely determines an element's chemical behavior, and it can be read directly from the group number of the periodic table for main-group elements (groups 1, 2, and 13–18): sodium (group 1) has 1 valence electron, oxygen (group 16) has 6, and neon (group 18) has 8. The single organizing idea that explains almost all bonding behavior is the **octet rule**: atoms react in whatever way moves them toward a full valence shell — typically 8 electrons — because a filled outer shell is a lower-energy, more stable configuration.

The octet rule plays out in two ways, depending on how "expensive" it is to reach 8. Sodium, with 1 valence electron, simply loses it to become $\text{Na}^+$; chlorine, with 7 valence electrons, simply gains one to become $\text{Cl}^-$. The resulting ions attract each other electrostatically, forming the ionic bond in table salt, $\text{NaCl}$. Carbon, with 4 valence electrons, faces a different trade-off: losing or gaining 4 electrons is too costly, so instead it *shares* electrons — a covalent bond — with other atoms. In methane, $\text{CH}_4$, carbon forms four such shared pairs, completing its own octet while also satisfying each hydrogen's smaller requirement of 2 electrons (hydrogen's shell is full at 2, not 8).

To apply the octet rule as a problem-solving tool, take any main-group element and ask: what is the shortest path to a full outer shell — losing electrons, gaining electrons, or sharing them? Try phosphorus, which has 5 valence electrons: losing 5 is costly, so it instead gains 3 electrons (or shares 3 pairs) to reach 8. This matches the phosphide ion $\text{P}^{3-}$ and covalent compounds like $\text{PH}_3$, both reachable from the same reasoning that predicted $\text{NaCl}$ and $\text{CH}_4$.

---

## Chemical Bond

A chemical bond is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms together in a stable arrangement, formed when electrons are transferred between atoms or shared between them. Bonds arise because atoms tend toward configurations of lower potential energy — typically a filled outer electron shell — and forming a bond is energetically favorable compared to remaining as isolated atoms. The three principal types are ionic bonds (electrons transferred, producing oppositely charged ions that attract each other electrostatically), covalent bonds (electrons shared between atoms, usually those with similar electronegativity), and metallic bonds (electrons delocalized across a lattice of metal cations). The type of bond that forms depends largely on the electronegativity difference between the atoms involved — how strongly each atom pulls on shared electrons.

**Worked example.** Consider sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). Sodium has one valence electron it can easily lose to reach a stable configuration; chlorine has seven valence electrons and needs just one more to complete its octet. Sodium transfers its electron to chlorine, producing $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ions. The resulting electrostatic attraction is an ionic bond, and the compound $\text{NaCl}$ is table salt. Contrast this with two chlorine atoms bonding to form $\text{Cl}_2$: since both atoms have identical electronegativity, neither can pull an electron away from the other, so they instead share a pair of electrons — a covalent bond.

**Problem-solving application.** A useful diagnostic is electronegativity difference ($\Delta$EN), computed by subtracting the electronegativity values of the two bonded atoms (found on any electronegativity table). As a rule of thumb: $\Delta$EN $> 1.7$ suggests an ionic bond, $\Delta$EN between roughly $0.4$ and $1.7$ suggests a polar covalent bond (shared electrons, but unevenly), and $\Delta$EN $< 0.4$ suggests a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, given a compound like $\text{HF}$ (H: EN $\approx 2.1$, F: EN $\approx 4.0$), $\Delta$EN $\approx 1.9$, predicting a bond so polar it borders on ionic — consistent with HF's known behavior as a strongly polar molecule. This kind of prediction matters in practice: it lets a chemist anticipate solubility, melting point, and reactivity of a new compound before ever synthesizing it, simply from the identities of the atoms involved.

## Octet Rule

Atoms other than hydrogen and helium tend to be most stable when their valence (outermost) shell holds eight electrons — an arrangement that mimics the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. This tendency, called the octet rule, explains why atoms form the specific number of bonds they do and why certain ions carry the charges they carry. Electrons in a full octet fill the $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the valence shell, producing a configuration with unusually low energy and little tendency to react further — the same reason noble gases like neon and argon exist as stable, unreactive single atoms.

Consider sodium chloride, $\text{NaCl}$. A neutral sodium atom has the configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^1$: one lone electron sits outside a complete neon-like core. Rather than trying to gain seven more electrons, sodium loses that single electron, becoming $\text{Na}^+$ with the stable $[\text{Ne}]$ configuration. Chlorine, with configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^23p^5$, is one electron short of an octet; it readily accepts sodium's donated electron to become $\text{Cl}^-$, matching the configuration of argon. The transferred electron leaves both ions with full octets, and the resulting electrostatic attraction forms an ionic bond.

The octet rule is equally useful for predicting covalent bonding patterns. Carbon, with four valence electrons, needs four more to reach eight; it achieves this by forming four shared bonding pairs, as in methane, $\text{CH}_4$. To apply the rule as a problem-solving tool, count each atom's valence electrons, determine how many more are needed to reach eight (or two, for hydrogen), and use that deficit to predict the number of bonds or the ionic charge. For example, oxygen (six valence electrons) is predicted to form two bonds or gain two electrons to become $\text{O}^{2-}$ — consistent with water's two O–H bonds and with the formula of magnesium oxide, $\text{MgO}$.

The rule has known exceptions — boron compounds with fewer than eight electrons, sulfur or phosphorus compounds with expanded octets, and odd-electron radicals like $\text{NO}$ — but as a first approximation it remains the fastest way to predict formulas, charges, and bonding patterns across the periodic table.

## Covalent Bond

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, with the shared pair(s) occupying the space between the nuclei and holding them together through mutual electrostatic attraction. This bonding strategy is favored by nonmetals, whose atoms have similarly high electronegativities — none is willing to fully surrender an electron to the other, so they compromise by sharing. Each shared pair counts as one bond; two pairs make a double bond, three make a triple bond. The number of bonds an atom forms is governed by the octet rule: atoms tend to share enough electrons to reach eight valence electrons (two, for hydrogen), matching the stable electron configuration of the nearest noble gas.

**Worked example.** Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon has four valence electrons and needs four more to reach an octet; each hydrogen has one valence electron and needs one more to reach two. Carbon forms four single bonds, one to each hydrogen, sharing one electron pair per bond. This satisfies carbon's octet (four bonding pairs = eight electrons around carbon) and each hydrogen's duet simultaneously. Now consider carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: oxygen needs two more electrons per atom, and carbon needs four more. A single bond to each oxygen would leave carbon two electrons short, so carbon instead forms a double bond with each oxygen — four shared electrons per bond, two bonds — giving carbon a full octet ($2+2+2+2=8$) and each oxygen a full octet as well.

**Problem-solving application.** Given only a molecular formula, you can predict the bonding pattern by counting total valence electrons and distributing them to satisfy every atom's octet (or duet, for hydrogen) with the fewest unshared "leftover" electrons possible. Try it with ammonia, $\text{NH}_3$: nitrogen contributes 5 valence electrons, each hydrogen contributes 1, for a total of 8. Three N–H single bonds use 6 electrons (3 pairs), leaving 2 electrons — one lone pair — on nitrogen, which completes its octet ($6 + 2 = 8$) without needing any double bonds. This electron-counting method — tally valence electrons, assign bonds to satisfy each atom's stable configuration, place remainders as lone pairs — works for predicting the structure of any small molecule built from period-2 nonmetals, and it is the same reasoning you will later extend to explain molecular shape and reactivity.

## Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts the shared electrons in a chemical bond toward itself. It is not a directly measurable physical quantity like mass or charge; rather, it is a comparative scale, built from bond energies, that lets chemists predict how electron density will be distributed when two atoms bond. The most widely used scale, developed by Linus Pauling, assigns dimensionless values ranging from about 0.7 (cesium) to 4.0 (fluorine). Across a period, electronegativity increases from left to right as nuclear charge grows while atomic radius shrinks, pulling bonding electrons closer to the nucleus. Down a group, electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increases and outer electrons sit farther from the nucleus, shielded by inner electron shells.

**Worked example.** Consider the bond in HCl. Chlorine's electronegativity is 3.16, hydrogen's is 2.20. The difference, $\Delta\chi = 3.16 - 2.20 = 0.96$, is large enough to make the bond polar covalent: chlorine pulls the shared electron pair toward itself, creating a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) on Cl and a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) on H. Compare this to the C–H bond in methane, where $\Delta\chi = 2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35$ — small enough that the bond is treated as essentially nonpolar.

**Problem-solving application.** Electronegativity differences let you predict both bond type and molecular behavior without running an experiment. As a rule of thumb: $\Delta\chi < 0.5$ indicates a nonpolar covalent bond, $0.5 \le \Delta\chi < 1.7$ indicates a polar covalent bond, and $\Delta\chi \ge 1.7$ indicates a bond that is predominantly ionic. Apply this to NaCl: $\chi_{\text{Cl}} - \chi_{\text{Na}} = 3.16 - 0.93 = 2.23$, correctly predicting an ionic bond. This same logic extends to predicting molecular polarity: in CO$_2$, each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta\chi = 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89$), but the linear geometry causes the two bond dipoles to cancel, making the overall molecule nonpolar — a reminder that electronegativity predicts bond polarity, while molecular polarity also depends on geometry. This combined reasoning is essential for predicting solubility, boiling points, and reactivity patterns across organic and inorganic chemistry.

## Proton

A proton is a subatomic particle carrying one positive elementary charge, $+1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$, and a mass of approximately $1.673 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg}$ — roughly 1,836 times heavier than an electron. Protons reside in the atomic nucleus alongside neutrons, bound together by the strong nuclear force, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion that positively charged protons exert on one another at close range. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus, called the atomic number $Z$, uniquely determines the chemical identity of an element: every carbon atom has exactly 6 protons, every oxygen atom exactly 8, and so on. Because protons are conserved in ordinary chemical reactions, $Z$ never changes when atoms bond, break apart, or rearrange — only nuclear reactions (fission, fusion, radioactive decay) can alter proton count.

Consider a neutral atom of nitrogen, which has $Z = 14$. Since the atom is electrically neutral, it must carry 14 electrons to balance the 14 positive charges from its protons. If this atom loses three electrons to form a nitrogen ion, the proton count stays fixed at 14, but the ion now carries a net charge of $+3$, written $\text{N}^{3+}$. This illustrates a key distinction: protons define what an element *is*, while electrons (which can be gained or lost) determine an atom's ionic charge and much of its chemical behavior.

This distinction becomes a practical tool when identifying atoms and ions from data. Suppose a particle has 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and 18 electrons. The proton count immediately identifies the element as chlorine ($Z = 17$). The mass number, $A = Z + N = 17 + 18 = 35$, tells you this is the chlorine-35 isotope. Comparing protons (17) to electrons (18) shows one extra electron, giving a net charge of $-1$: this is the chloride ion, $^{35}\text{Cl}^-$. Working through such problems — given proton, neutron, and electron counts, determine the element, isotope, and charge — is the core skill built from understanding what a proton represents: the invariant fingerprint of an element, distinct from the variable neutron count (isotopes) and variable electron count (ions) that can change around it.

---

## Ion

An ion is an atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, giving it a net electric charge. In a neutral atom, the number of protons (positive charge) equals the number of electrons (negative charge), so the charges cancel. Remove an electron and the atom becomes positively charged, since it now has more protons than electrons; this is called a cation. Add an electron and the atom becomes negatively charged, an anion, since electrons now outnumber protons. The number of protons never changes during ionization — that would make it a different element entirely — only the electron count shifts.

Consider sodium (Na), which has 11 protons and, in its neutral state, 11 electrons. Sodium readily loses its single outermost electron to achieve a stable, filled-shell configuration like neon. It becomes Na⁺, with 11 protons and only 10 electrons, giving a net charge of +1. Chlorine (Cl), with 17 protons and 17 electrons, tends to gain one electron to fill its outer shell like argon, becoming Cl⁻, with 17 protons and 18 electrons, a net charge of −1. These two ions attract each other electrostatically and combine to form table salt, NaCl — a compound held together by an ionic bond, which is fundamentally the attraction between oppositely charged ions.

To predict whether an atom forms a cation or anion, and how many charges it carries, look at its position on the periodic table. Elements in Group 1 (like Na, K) lose one electron to form +1 ions; Group 2 elements (like Mg, Ca) lose two electrons to form +2 ions. Elements in Group 17 (like Cl, F) gain one electron to form −1 ions; Group 16 elements (like O, S) gain two electrons to form −2 ions. This pattern reflects each element's drive to reach a stable electron configuration, usually a filled outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule).

**Problem-solving application**: Suppose you need to determine the charge and electron count of a calcium ion, Ca²⁺, given that neutral calcium has 20 protons and 20 electrons. Since the ion carries a +2 charge, it has 2 fewer electrons than protons: $20 - 2 = 18$ electrons, matching the stable configuration of argon. This same subtraction logic — protons minus net charge equals electron count — applies to any ion you encounter, whether predicting formulas for ionic compounds or balancing charges in a chemical equation.

---

## Molecule

A molecule is a group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds, arranged in a fixed ratio and geometry that determines the substance's identity and properties. Bonds form because atoms share or transfer electrons to reach a more stable electron configuration — typically a filled outer shell. Two atoms of the same element can bond (O$_2$, N$_2$), or different elements can combine (H$_2$O, CO$_2$). The molecular formula tells you *what* atoms are present and in what count; the molecular structure tells you *how* they're arranged in space, and structure is often what governs behavior.

**Worked example.** Consider water, H$_2$O. Two hydrogen atoms each share one electron with oxygen, forming two covalent bonds. Because oxygen holds the shared electrons more tightly than hydrogen (it's more electronegative), the bonding electrons sit closer to oxygen. This makes the oxygen end of the molecule slightly negative and the hydrogen ends slightly positive — a polar molecule. The bent shape (not linear) results from oxygen's two lone electron pairs pushing the hydrogens together at about $104.5°$. This polarity and geometry explain why water dissolves salts, forms hydrogen bonds with itself (giving it a high boiling point relative to its size), and beads up on a waxy, nonpolar surface.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given two compounds, CO$_2$ and SO$_2$, and asked to predict which one is polar. Both have a central atom double-bonded to two oxygens, so you can't rely on the formula alone — you need the structure. CO$_2$ is linear: the two C=O bond dipoles point in exactly opposite directions and cancel, making the molecule nonpolar overall even though each bond is polar. SO$_2$ is bent, like water, because sulfur carries a lone pair that bends the molecule; the two S=O dipoles don't cancel, so SO$_2$ is polar. This is the general problem-solving move for molecules: identify the atoms and bonds from the formula, then determine geometry (using lone pairs and bonding pairs around the central atom) before concluding anything about polarity, reactivity, or physical properties. Formula alone is rarely enough — shape is what connects a molecule's composition to its real-world behavior.

---

## Polar Covalent Bond

When two atoms share electrons unequally, the bond between them is a polar covalent bond. This happens whenever the atoms differ in electronegativity — the tendency of an atom to pull shared electrons toward itself. If the electronegativity difference is small (roughly 0 to 0.4 on the Pauling scale), the bond is essentially nonpolar covalent, with electrons shared almost equally. If the difference is large (above about 1.7), electrons are transferred rather than shared, and the bond is ionic instead. Polar covalent bonds occupy the middle ground, typically a difference between 0.4 and 1.7. The more electronegative atom acquires a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$), and the less electronegative atom acquires a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$), even though no full electron transfer occurs.

**Worked example.** Consider the H–Cl bond in hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen has an electronegativity of about 2.20, and chlorine has about 3.16, giving a difference of 0.96. Chlorine pulls the shared electron pair closer to itself, producing $H^{\delta+}$—$Cl^{\delta-}$. This is why HCl has a permanent dipole moment (about 1.08 D) and dissolves readily in water, where it ionizes almost completely into $H^+$ and $Cl^-$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a molecule's bonds and asked to predict overall polarity — a task that appears constantly in organic chemistry and biochemistry when predicting solubility, reactivity, or intermolecular forces. The procedure is: (1) calculate the electronegativity difference for each bond to classify it as nonpolar, polar covalent, or ionic; (2) determine the direction of each bond dipole using the electronegativity values; (3) consider the molecular geometry, since individual bond dipoles can cancel by symmetry even if each bond is individually polar. Carbon dioxide illustrates step 3: each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta EN \approx 0.89$), but the linear geometry makes the two dipoles point in opposite directions, canceling to give a nonpolar molecule overall. Water, by contrast, is bent, so its two O–H bond dipoles reinforce rather than cancel, making $H_2O$ strongly polar. This distinction — polar bonds versus polar molecules — is the key problem-solving skill: bond polarity is necessary but not sufficient to predict molecular polarity; geometry always has the final say.

---

## Ionic Bond

An ionic bond is the electrostatic attraction that holds together oppositely charged ions in a compound. It forms when one atom transfers one or more electrons to another, typically a metal losing electrons to become a cation ($\text{X}^{n+}$) and a nonmetal gaining them to become an anion ($\text{Y}^{n-}$). The driving force is each atom's tendency to reach a stable, filled outer electron shell — usually the noble-gas configuration described by the octet rule. Unlike covalent bonds, where electrons are shared, ionic bonding involves complete electron transfer, and the resulting attraction is non-directional, extending in all directions and giving rise to a repeating crystal lattice rather than discrete molecules.

**Worked example.** Consider sodium chloride, $\text{NaCl}$. Sodium (electron configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^1$) readily loses its single valence electron to form $\text{Na}^+$, which has the stable configuration of neon. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) readily gains that electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$, achieving the configuration of argon. The transferred electron leaves sodium positively charged and makes chlorine negatively charged; the two ions then attract each other according to Coulomb's law, $F = k\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the ion charges and $r$ is the distance between them. Because this attraction is not confined to a single pair, each $\text{Na}^+$ ion surrounds itself with multiple $\text{Cl}^-$ neighbors and vice versa, producing the cubic lattice observed in table salt.

**Problem-solving application.** Given the empirical formula of an ionic compound, you should be able to predict its charge balance and structure. For example, magnesium oxide, $\text{MgO}$, forms from $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\text{O}^{2-}$: two electrons transfer from magnesium to oxygen, and the 2:2 charge ratio requires only a 1:1 ion ratio for electrical neutrality. Contrast this with calcium chloride, $\text{CaCl}_2$, where $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ must pair with two $\text{Cl}^-$ ions to balance charge. This charge-balancing logic — matching total positive and negative charge to determine the subscript ratio — is the core skill for predicting formulas of ionic compounds from the periodic table alone, and it also explains macroscopic properties: because breaking a lattice requires disrupting many simultaneous ionic attractions, ionic compounds tend to have high melting points and conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as in a molten or dissolved state.

## Water Polarity

Water's chemical formula, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, hides the geometric and electrical asymmetry that makes it one of the most consequential molecules in chemistry and biology. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen — it pulls the shared bonding electrons in each O–H bond closer to itself. This unequal sharing leaves oxygen with a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) and each hydrogen with a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$). Because the molecule is bent (roughly 104.5° between the two O–H bonds, not linear), these charge imbalances don't cancel out. The result is a *polar* molecule: one with a permanent, unevenly distributed charge, often summarized as a molecular dipole.

**Worked example.** Compare water to carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$. Both molecules contain polar bonds — carbon and oxygen also differ in electronegativity. But $\text{CO}_2$ is linear, with the two C=O bond dipoles pointing in exactly opposite directions. They cancel, so $\text{CO}_2$ is a nonpolar molecule overall. Water's bent shape prevents this cancellation: the two O–H dipoles add together instead, producing a net dipole pointing from the hydrogens toward the oxygen. This comparison shows that polarity depends on both bond character *and* molecular geometry — you cannot predict it from the atoms alone.

**Problem-solving application.** Polarity explains why water dissolves salts and sugars but not oils. When table salt (NaCl) is added to water, the $\delta^-$ oxygen ends of surrounding water molecules orient toward $\text{Na}^+$ ions, while the $\delta^+$ hydrogens orient toward $\text{Cl}^-$ ions — the ionic bond is overwhelmed, and the salt dissolves. Oils, made of nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, have no charge separation for water to interact with, so water molecules preferentially bond to each other, excluding the oil — the basis of the phrase "oil and water don't mix." If you're asked to predict whether a new compound will be water-soluble, the practical test is: does it have charged or highly electronegative atoms (like O, N, or charged groups) that can form these attractive interactions with water's partial charges? If yes, expect solubility; if it's a long, uniform hydrocarbon chain, expect it to resist mixing with water.

## Solvent

A solvent is the substance in a solution present in the greatest amount — the medium that dissolves another substance, called the solute, to form a homogeneous mixture. Water is the most familiar solvent, often called the "universal solvent" because its polarity lets it dissolve an enormous range of ionic and polar substances, from table salt to sugar to many biological molecules. But countless other solvents exist: ethanol, acetone, and various hydrocarbons are common in laboratories, industry, and household products like nail polish remover or paint thinner.

Whether a solvent can dissolve a given solute comes down to a single organizing principle: "like dissolves like." Polar solvents, whose molecules have an uneven distribution of electric charge, readily dissolve polar or ionic solutes because the partially charged regions of the solvent molecules attract and surround the charged or polar solute particles, pulling them apart and keeping them suspended. Nonpolar solvents, lacking this charge separation, dissolve nonpolar substances such as oils and fats through weaker, uniform intermolecular attractions. This is why water and oil do not mix — water's polar molecules cannot effectively interact with oil's nonpolar ones — while oil dissolves readily in a nonpolar solvent like hexane.

This principle has direct problem-solving value. Suppose you need to remove a grease stain from fabric. Grease is nonpolar, so plain water — a polar solvent — will be ineffective no matter how vigorously you scrub. The fix follows directly from "like dissolves like": you need something that can bridge both worlds. Soap does exactly this — each soap molecule has a nonpolar tail that dissolves into the grease and a polar head that stays compatible with water, so the grease gets pulled off the fabric and rinsed away with the water.

This same logic guides real decisions elsewhere. A chemist extracting a nonpolar natural product from plant material chooses a nonpolar solvent like hexane rather than water, for the same reason oil dissolves in hexane but not in water. In every such case, the first and most critical step in solving the problem is identifying whether the solute is polar or nonpolar and matching it to a solvent of the same character.

## Sphere Of Hydration

**Definition.** When an ionic or polar solid dissolves in water, each dissolved particle does not float freely in isolation. Instead, water molecules — themselves polar, with a partial negative charge on oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens — orient themselves around the particle and cling to it through ion-dipole or dipole-dipole attractions. This organized shell of surrounding water molecules is called the sphere of hydration (or hydration shell). It physically separates the dissolved particle from other ions or particles in solution, which is precisely what keeps a solute dissolved rather than settling back out as a solid.

**Worked example.** Consider table salt, NaCl, dissolving in water. As the crystal lattice breaks apart, each $\text{Na}^+$ cation becomes surrounded by water molecules oriented with their oxygen (partial negative) ends pointing inward, toward the cation. Each $\text{Cl}^-$ anion becomes surrounded by water molecules oriented the opposite way, with their hydrogen (partial positive) ends pointing inward. In both cases, a shell of several water molecules forms around the ion, shielding it electrically. Because $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ are now each wrapped in their own hydration sphere, they no longer attract each other strongly enough to reform the crystal — the solution stays dissolved rather than the salt precipitating back out.

**Problem-solving application.** The concept of the hydration sphere lets you predict and explain solubility behavior. Suppose you are asked why $\text{MgCl}_2$ dissolves readily in water but a nonpolar substance like oil does not. Reasoning through hydration spheres: $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ carries a higher charge density than $\text{Na}^+$, so it attracts water molecules more strongly and forms a larger, tighter hydration shell — this is consistent with $\text{MgCl}_2$'s high solubility and the substantial heat released when it dissolves. Oil molecules, by contrast, have no significant charge or polarity for water to grip, so water molecules cannot form a stabilizing shell around them; instead, water excludes the oil, driving the hydrophobic effect. You can use this same reasoning to predict relative solubilities: ions with higher charge or smaller radius (higher charge density) generally form stronger hydration spheres and dissolve more readily, while nonpolar molecules resist dissolution in water regardless of size.

## Dissociation

Dissociation is the process by which a compound separates into simpler particles — ions or molecules — when it dissolves, especially in water. It is not a chemical reaction that creates new bonds so much as one that breaks existing ones, releasing the components that were held together in the solid or molten compound. Ionic compounds dissociate into their constituent ions when placed in a polar solvent like water: table salt, $\text{NaCl}$, separates into $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ as water molecules surround and stabilize each ion. This is distinct from ionization, where a molecule that was not originally ionic (like $\text{HCl}$ gas) reacts with water to *form* ions; in practice, though, both processes are often grouped together because the end result — free-moving charged particles in solution — is the same.

Consider dissolving calcium chloride, $\text{CaCl}_2$, in water. The dissociation equation is:
$$\text{CaCl}_2(s) \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{O}} \text{Ca}^{2+}(aq) + 2\,\text{Cl}^-(aq)$$
Notice that one formula unit produces three ions total: one calcium ion and two chloride ions. This matters because dissociation directly determines a solution's electrical conductivity and its colligative properties (like freezing point depression), which depend on the total number of dissolved particles, not the number of original formula units.

This leads to a practical problem-solving skill: predicting the number of particles produced per formula unit, called the van't Hoff factor, $i$. For a strong electrolyte that dissociates completely, $i$ equals the number of ions in the formula. For example, $\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3$ dissociates as:
$$\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3(s) \rightarrow 2\,\text{Al}^{3+}(aq) + 3\,\text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq)$$
giving $i = 5$. This value is used directly in calculations such as freezing point depression, $\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m$, where $m$ is molality. If a chemist dissolves $0.10\ \text{mol}$ of $\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3$ in $1\ \text{kg}$ of water, the effective particle concentration is $0.10 \times 5 = 0.50\ \text{mol/kg}$, not $0.10\ \text{mol/kg}$ — a five-fold difference that would be missed if dissociation were ignored. Correctly counting dissociated species is therefore essential whenever a problem links concentration to a solution's physical or electrical behavior.

## Electrolytes

Electrolytes are salts—compounds such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium carbonate—that dissociate into charged ions (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Cl⁻, and others) when dissolved in the water of body fluids. Because these ions carry electric charge, their movement across cell membranes generates the electrical signals that drive nerve impulses and muscle contractions, and their concentration gradients regulate how water distributes between the inside and outside of cells. Unlike glucose or fats, which are broken down for energy, electrolytes function through their charge and concentration, not through chemical combustion.

Consider a neuron at rest: its interior holds a high concentration of K⁺ and a low concentration of Na⁺, while the fluid outside reverses this pattern. This imbalance, maintained by sodium-potassium pumps, creates a voltage difference of about $-70\text{ mV}$ across the membrane. When the neuron is stimulated, sodium channels open, Na⁺ rushes in, and the membrane potential rapidly shifts—this is the electrical signal, called an action potential, that we recognize as a nerve impulse. Potassium then flows back out to restore the resting state. Without a steady supply of Na⁺ and K⁺, this cycle cannot function, which is why severe electrolyte imbalances can cause muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, or seizures.

Electrolyte problems appear constantly in applied and clinical contexts. Suppose an endurance athlete loses 2 liters of sweat during a race, and sweat contains roughly 1 gram of sodium chloride per liter. That athlete has lost about 2 grams of NaCl, or roughly 0.8 grams of sodium—enough to disrupt nerve and muscle signaling if not replaced, producing cramps or dizziness. This is why sports drinks are formulated with sodium and potassium rather than pure water: replacing water alone would dilute the remaining electrolytes further, worsening the imbalance rather than fixing it (a phenomenon called hyponatremia).

In clinical settings, doctors order a "basic metabolic panel" precisely to measure blood levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, because deviations from normal ranges are diagnostic red flags for dehydration, kidney dysfunction, or hormonal disorders. Understanding electrolytes as charge carriers rather than simple nutrients allows you to interpret these medical numbers, design oral rehydration solutions, and reason about why certain medications (like diuretics) require potassium monitoring to prevent dangerous imbalances.

## Payoff

Electrolytes are the concept where chemistry stops being abstract and starts being functional. An electrolyte is any substance that, when dissolved in a solvent, dissociates into ions and thereby allows the solution to conduct electricity. This single idea — that ionic dissociation converts a chemical system into an electrical one — is the natural endpoint of the book because it is the bridge connecting atomic structure, bonding, and solution chemistry to the machinery of the physical and biological world. Once you understand why $\text{NaCl}$ splits into $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ in water while sugar does not ionize at all, you possess the conceptual key to explain phenomena as different as a battery discharging, a nerve firing, and an IV drip restoring a dehydrated patient.

Consider a worked example: a hospital saline drip is essentially a $0.9\%$ solution of $\text{NaCl}$, chosen because it matches the ionic strength of blood plasma. If the concentration were wrong, water would rush into or out of cells by osmosis, disrupting cellular function — a direct, practical consequence of electrolyte concentration that a clinician must calculate correctly.

This concept radiates outward into every domain this book has built toward. In **energy storage**, batteries and fuel cells rely on electrolytes to shuttle ions between electrodes, converting chemical potential into usable current — the same dissociation principle scaled into engineered devices. In **human physiology**, electrolytes like $\text{K}^+$, $\text{Na}^+$, and $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ generate the electrical gradients that fire neurons and contract muscles, making rehydration therapy and cardiac medicine direct applications of ionic balance. In **environmental and water science**, measuring dissolved ion concentration (conductivity) is the standard proxy for water quality and salinity. In **industrial chemistry**, electrolysis — driving a non-spontaneous reaction with an external current — depends entirely on having a conductive ionic solution, underlying processes from metal refining to hydrogen production.

Each of these applications is a different lens on the same underlying idea: ions in solution carry both mass and charge, and controlling that ionic environment lets us store energy, sustain life, monitor ecosystems, or manufacture materials. Pick one of these domains — energy storage is a natural choice — and trace how electrolyte concentration and ion mobility determine a battery's voltage and capacity.
