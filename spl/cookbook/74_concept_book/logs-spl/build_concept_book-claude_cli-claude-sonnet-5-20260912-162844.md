## Atom

An **atom** is the smallest unit of an element that retains that element's chemical identity. Atoms are the building blocks of all ordinary matter — every solid, liquid, and gas you encounter is made of atoms bonded together or moving freely. Each atom consists of a dense, positively charged **nucleus** (containing protons and neutrons) surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged **electrons**. The number of protons in the nucleus is the **atomic number** ($Z$), which uniquely identifies the element. A neutral atom has exactly as many electrons as protons. The **mass number** ($A$) equals the total count of protons and neutrons: $A = Z + N$, where $N$ is the number of neutrons.

**Worked example.** A neutral atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. Identify the element, write its symbol, and determine how many electrons it has.

- $Z = 17$ → element is **Chlorine (Cl)**
- $A = 17 + 18 = 35$ → symbol: $^{35}_{17}\text{Cl}$
- Neutral atom: electrons $= Z = 17$

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are given a mystery atom with mass number 23 and 12 neutrons. Find $Z$, identify the element, and predict whether it is likely to gain or lose electrons in a chemical reaction.

Step 1: $Z = A - N = 23 - 12 = 11$ → **Sodium (Na)**  
Step 2: Sodium sits in Group 1 of the periodic table, meaning it has 1 valence electron. Atoms seek a stable octet; losing that single electron costs far less energy than gaining seven. Sodium therefore **loses 1 electron** to form $\text{Na}^+$.

This reasoning — atomic number gives identity, valence electron count predicts reactivity — is the core skill. Every chemical equation, every material property, and every biological molecule ultimately traces back to how individual atoms are structured and how they interact.

## Electron

An electron is a subatomic particle carrying a single unit of negative electric charge, approximately $-1.602 \times 10^{-19}\text{ C}$, and a mass of about $9.109 \times 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$ — roughly 1/1836 the mass of a proton. Electrons occupy the space around an atomic nucleus, and their arrangement determines nearly every chemical and electrical property of matter: how atoms bond, how materials conduct electricity, and how light interacts with substances. Unlike a planet orbiting the sun, an electron does not follow a fixed path; quantum mechanics describes its location only probabilistically, in terms of regions called orbitals where it is likely to be found.

**Worked example.** Consider a neutral carbon atom, atomic number 6, meaning it has 6 protons and therefore 6 electrons. These electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy: 2 electrons occupy the innermost shell, and the remaining 4 occupy the second shell. This second-shell arrangement of 4 electrons — not enough to fill the shell, but more than half full — is exactly why carbon can form four bonds with other atoms, making it the backbone of organic chemistry. Contrast this with neon (atomic number 10), whose second shell is completely full with 8 electrons, leaving it chemically inert. The number of outer, or "valence," electrons is the single most predictive fact about how an element behaves.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are asked to predict whether magnesium (atomic number 12) will tend to lose or gain electrons when forming a compound. Its electron arrangement is 2, 8, 2 — two electrons sit alone in the outermost shell. Removing those two is easier than acquiring six more to fill the shell, so magnesium loses them, forming a $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion. This same reasoning — count the valence electrons, then judge whether losing or gaining fewer electrons gets the atom to a full outer shell — lets you predict the charge and reactivity of almost any element on the periodic table, and explains why table salt forms as $\text{Na}^+\text{Cl}^-$ rather than some other combination. This predictive power is what makes the electron, despite its tiny mass, central to chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering alike.

## Electron Orbital

An electron orbital is a mathematical description of the region around an atomic nucleus where an electron has a high probability of being found. Unlike the fixed circular paths in early atomic models, an orbital is derived from solving the Schrödinger equation for an electron bound to a nucleus. The solution, called a wave function $\psi$, does not tell you exactly where the electron is at any instant — quantum mechanics forbids that kind of certainty. Instead, $|\psi|^2$ gives the *probability density*: the likelihood of detecting the electron in a small volume of space. An orbital is the three-dimensional shape enclosing the region where that probability is high, typically drawn to contain about 90% of the electron's likely location.

Each orbital is labeled by quantum numbers that determine its size, shape, and orientation. The $s$ orbitals are spherical; $p$ orbitals have two lobes on either side of the nucleus; $d$ and $f$ orbitals have more complex, multi-lobed shapes. These shapes are not arbitrary — they emerge directly from the mathematics of standing waves confined near a nucleus, similar to how a vibrating drumhead produces specific standing-wave patterns rather than random shapes.

**Worked example.** Consider the hydrogen atom's $1s$ orbital, the lowest-energy solution. Its probability density is highest very close to the nucleus and decreases smoothly outward, with no directional preference — hence the spherical shape. If a chemist wants to predict whether hydrogen will bond with another atom, they examine where this spherical electron density overlaps with the orbital of the approaching atom; bonding orbitals form where these regions constructively overlap.

**Problem-solving application.** Orbital shapes and energies explain the structure of the periodic table and predict chemical behavior. For instance, to determine why carbon forms four bonds rather than two, chemists apply orbital hybridization: carbon's $2s$ and three $2p$ orbitals mix to form four equivalent $sp^3$ orbitals, each capable of pairing with another atom's electron. This reasoning — starting from orbital shape and energy, then predicting bonding capacity — is the standard problem-solving approach in introductory chemistry for explaining molecular geometry, reactivity, and bond strength across the periodic table.

## Electron Shell

The electron shell model describes electrons as occupying discrete energy levels, or shells, at characteristic distances from the nucleus, rather than orbiting at arbitrary radii. Each shell is labeled by a principal quantum number $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, with $n=1$ closest to the nucleus and lowest in energy. Electrons can only exist in these fixed levels — never between them — a direct consequence of quantum mechanics, where bound electrons occupy quantized energy states. The maximum number of electrons a shell can hold is given by $2n^2$: shell 1 holds up to 2, shell 2 up to 8, shell 3 up to 18, and so on. Electrons fill lower shells before occupying higher ones, and an atom's outermost shell — the valence shell — determines nearly all of its chemical behavior, since it is the electrons there that are gained, lost, or shared in bonding.

Consider sodium (atomic number 11). Its electrons fill shells according to $2n^2$, giving a configuration of 2, 8, 1. The first shell fills with 2, the second with 8 (its maximum), leaving 1 electron in the third shell. That lone valence electron makes sodium highly reactive: it readily loses this electron to achieve a stable, filled outer shell, which is exactly why sodium forms a $+1$ ion in compounds like NaCl.

This model becomes a genuine problem-solving tool when predicting reactivity and bonding patterns. Suppose you are given chlorine (atomic number 17) and asked to predict how it will bond. Filling shells in order: 2, 8, 7. The outer shell has 7 electrons, one short of a filled 8-electron shell. Rather than losing 7 electrons, chlorine will preferentially gain 1 electron, forming a $-1$ ion — which is why it pairs naturally with sodium's donated electron in NaCl. More generally, elements with 1–3 valence electrons tend to lose them (forming metals and cations), those with 5–7 tend to gain electrons (forming nonmetals and anions), and those with a full valence shell (like neon, with configuration 2, 8) are chemically inert. Given only an atomic number, you can now determine shell filling, identify the valence electron count, and predict both the ionic charge an atom will adopt and its general reactivity — turning a simple counting rule into a working model of chemical behavior.

## Electron Configuration

**Definition.** An electron configuration is a shorthand notation describing how electrons are distributed among an atom's orbitals. Electrons fill orbitals according to three governing rules: the **Aufbau principle** (electrons occupy the lowest-energy orbitals available first), the **Pauli exclusion principle** (each orbital holds at most two electrons, with opposite spins), and **Hund's rule** (electrons fill degenerate orbitals — orbitals of equal energy, like the three $p$ orbitals — singly before pairing up). Orbitals are labeled by principal quantum number $n$ and subshell type ($s$, $p$, $d$, $f$), with maximum electron capacities of 2, 6, 10, and 14 respectively. The filling order follows increasing $(n + \ell)$, summarized by the diagonal rule: $1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, \dots$

**Worked example.** Consider iron, $Z = 26$. Filling orbitals in order and tracking the electron count: $1s^2$ (2), $2s^2$ (4), $2p^6$ (10), $3s^2$ (12), $3p^6$ (18), $4s^2$ (20), $3d^6$ (26). The full configuration is:
$$1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^6\,3s^2\,3p^6\,4s^2\,3d^6$$
Note that $4s$ fills before $3d$ despite $3d$ belonging to a lower principal shell — this is because $4s$ has lower energy in neutral atoms at this point in the periodic table. A common shorthand uses the previous noble gas as a core: $[\text{Ar}]\,4s^2 3d^6$.

**Problem-solving application.** Electron configurations let you predict chemical behavior directly from an atom's position on the periodic table, without memorizing individual elements. Two skills matter most in practice:

1. *Predicting reactivity and ion charge.* Atoms tend toward configurations that fill or empty their outermost (valence) subshell. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) is one electron short of a filled $3p^6$ shell, so it readily gains an electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$. Magnesium ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2$) loses its two valence electrons to form $\text{Mg}^{2+}$, achieving the neon configuration.

2. *Handling exceptions.* Some transition metals deviate from the diagonal rule because half-filled or fully-filled $d$ subshells are unusually stable. Chromium is $[\text{Ar}]4s^1 3d^5$ rather than the "expected" $4s^2 3d^4$, since a half-filled $3d^5$ lowers overall energy through reduced electron-electron repulsion.

When solving configuration problems, always cross-check your electron count against $Z$, and for ions, remove or add electrons from the *outermost* shell first — even when that means removing $4s$ electrons before $3d$ electrons, since $3d$ becomes lower in energy than $4s$ once occupied.

## Valence Shell

The valence shell is the outermost occupied electron shell of an atom — the region farthest from the nucleus that still holds electrons. Electrons in this shell are called valence electrons, and they are the ones directly involved in forming chemical bonds. Inner-shell ("core") electrons are held tightly by the nucleus and rarely participate in bonding, while valence electrons are more loosely bound and more exposed, making them the atom's "handshake" with the outside world.

The number of valence electrons is what largely determines an element's chemical behavior, and it can be read directly from the group number of the periodic table for main-group elements (groups 1, 2, and 13–18): sodium (group 1) has 1 valence electron, oxygen (group 16) has 6, and neon (group 18) has 8. The single organizing idea that explains almost all bonding behavior is the **octet rule**: atoms react in whatever way moves them toward a full valence shell — typically 8 electrons — because a filled outer shell is a lower-energy, more stable configuration.

The octet rule plays out in two ways, depending on how "expensive" it is to reach 8. Sodium, with 1 valence electron, simply loses it to become $\text{Na}^+$; chlorine, with 7 valence electrons, simply gains one to become $\text{Cl}^-$. The resulting ions attract each other electrostatically, forming the ionic bond in table salt, $\text{NaCl}$. Carbon, with 4 valence electrons, faces a different trade-off: losing or gaining 4 electrons is too costly, so instead it *shares* electrons — a covalent bond — with other atoms. In methane, $\text{CH}_4$, carbon forms four such shared pairs, completing its own octet while also satisfying each hydrogen's smaller requirement of 2 electrons (hydrogen's shell is full at 2, not 8).

To apply the octet rule as a problem-solving tool, take any main-group element and ask: what is the shortest path to a full outer shell — losing electrons, gaining electrons, or sharing them? Try phosphorus, which has 5 valence electrons: losing 5 is costly, so it instead gains 3 electrons (or shares 3 pairs) to reach 8. This matches the phosphide ion $\text{P}^{3-}$ and covalent compounds like $\text{PH}_3$, both reachable from the same reasoning that predicted $\text{NaCl}$ and $\text{CH}_4$.

---

## Chemical Bond

A chemical bond is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms together in a stable arrangement, formed when electrons are transferred between atoms or shared between them. Bonds arise because atoms tend toward configurations of lower potential energy — typically a filled outer electron shell — and forming a bond is energetically favorable compared to remaining as isolated atoms. The three principal types are ionic bonds (electrons transferred, producing oppositely charged ions that attract each other electrostatically), covalent bonds (electrons shared between atoms, usually those with similar electronegativity), and metallic bonds (electrons delocalized across a lattice of metal cations). The type of bond that forms depends largely on the electronegativity difference between the atoms involved — how strongly each atom pulls on shared electrons.

**Worked example.** Consider sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). Sodium has one valence electron it can easily lose to reach a stable configuration; chlorine has seven valence electrons and needs just one more to complete its octet. Sodium transfers its electron to chlorine, producing $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ions. The resulting electrostatic attraction is an ionic bond, and the compound $\text{NaCl}$ is table salt. Contrast this with two chlorine atoms bonding to form $\text{Cl}_2$: since both atoms have identical electronegativity, neither can pull an electron away from the other, so they instead share a pair of electrons — a covalent bond.

**Problem-solving application.** A useful diagnostic is electronegativity difference ($\Delta$EN), computed by subtracting the electronegativity values of the two bonded atoms (found on any electronegativity table). As a rule of thumb: $\Delta$EN $> 1.7$ suggests an ionic bond, $\Delta$EN between roughly $0.4$ and $1.7$ suggests a polar covalent bond (shared electrons, but unevenly), and $\Delta$EN $< 0.4$ suggests a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, given a compound like $\text{HF}$ (H: EN $\approx 2.1$, F: EN $\approx 4.0$), $\Delta$EN $\approx 1.9$, predicting a bond so polar it borders on ionic — consistent with HF's known behavior as a strongly polar molecule. This kind of prediction matters in practice: it lets a chemist anticipate solubility, melting point, and reactivity of a new compound before ever synthesizing it, simply from the identities of the atoms involved.

## Octet Rule

Atoms other than hydrogen and helium tend to be most stable when their valence (outermost) shell holds eight electrons — an arrangement that mimics the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas. This tendency, called the octet rule, explains why atoms form the specific number of bonds they do and why certain ions carry the charges they carry. Electrons in a full octet fill the $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the valence shell, producing a configuration with unusually low energy and little tendency to react further — the same reason noble gases like neon and argon exist as stable, unreactive single atoms.

Consider sodium chloride, $\text{NaCl}$. A neutral sodium atom has the configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^1$: one lone electron sits outside a complete neon-like core. Rather than trying to gain seven more electrons, sodium loses that single electron, becoming $\text{Na}^+$ with the stable $[\text{Ne}]$ configuration. Chlorine, with configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^23p^5$, is one electron short of an octet; it readily accepts sodium's donated electron to become $\text{Cl}^-$, matching the configuration of argon. The transferred electron leaves both ions with full octets, and the resulting electrostatic attraction forms an ionic bond.

The octet rule is equally useful for predicting covalent bonding patterns. Carbon, with four valence electrons, needs four more to reach eight; it achieves this by forming four shared bonding pairs, as in methane, $\text{CH}_4$. To apply the rule as a problem-solving tool, count each atom's valence electrons, determine how many more are needed to reach eight (or two, for hydrogen), and use that deficit to predict the number of bonds or the ionic charge. For example, oxygen (six valence electrons) is predicted to form two bonds or gain two electrons to become $\text{O}^{2-}$ — consistent with water's two O–H bonds and with the formula of magnesium oxide, $\text{MgO}$.

The rule has known exceptions — boron compounds with fewer than eight electrons, sulfur or phosphorus compounds with expanded octets, and odd-electron radicals like $\text{NO}$ — but as a first approximation it remains the fastest way to predict formulas, charges, and bonding patterns across the periodic table.

## Covalent Bond

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, with the shared pair(s) occupying the space between the nuclei and holding them together through mutual electrostatic attraction. This bonding strategy is favored by nonmetals, whose atoms have similarly high electronegativities — none is willing to fully surrender an electron to the other, so they compromise by sharing. Each shared pair counts as one bond; two pairs make a double bond, three make a triple bond. The number of bonds an atom forms is governed by the octet rule: atoms tend to share enough electrons to reach eight valence electrons (two, for hydrogen), matching the stable electron configuration of the nearest noble gas.

**Worked example.** Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon has four valence electrons and needs four more to reach an octet; each hydrogen has one valence electron and needs one more to reach two. Carbon forms four single bonds, one to each hydrogen, sharing one electron pair per bond. This satisfies carbon's octet (four bonding pairs = eight electrons around carbon) and each hydrogen's duet simultaneously. Now consider carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: oxygen needs two more electrons per atom, and carbon needs four more. A single bond to each oxygen would leave carbon two electrons short, so carbon instead forms a double bond with each oxygen — four shared electrons per bond, two bonds — giving carbon a full octet ($2+2+2+2=8$) and each oxygen a full octet as well.

**Problem-solving application.** Given only a molecular formula, you can predict the bonding pattern by counting total valence electrons and distributing them to satisfy every atom's octet (or duet, for hydrogen) with the fewest unshared "leftover" electrons possible. Try it with ammonia, $\text{NH}_3$: nitrogen contributes 5 valence electrons, each hydrogen contributes 1, for a total of 8. Three N–H single bonds use 6 electrons (3 pairs), leaving 2 electrons — one lone pair — on nitrogen, which completes its octet ($6 + 2 = 8$) without needing any double bonds. This electron-counting method — tally valence electrons, assign bonds to satisfy each atom's stable configuration, place remainders as lone pairs — works for predicting the structure of any small molecule built from period-2 nonmetals, and it is the same reasoning you will later extend to explain molecular shape and reactivity.

## Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts the shared electrons in a chemical bond toward itself. It is not a directly measurable physical quantity like mass or charge; rather, it is a comparative scale, built from bond energies, that lets chemists predict how electron density will be distributed when two atoms bond. The most widely used scale, developed by Linus Pauling, assigns dimensionless values ranging from about 0.7 (cesium) to 4.0 (fluorine). Across a period, electronegativity increases from left to right as nuclear charge grows while atomic radius shrinks, pulling bonding electrons closer to the nucleus. Down a group, electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increases and outer electrons sit farther from the nucleus, shielded by inner electron shells.

**Worked example.** Consider the bond in HCl. Chlorine's electronegativity is 3.16, hydrogen's is 2.20. The difference, $\Delta\chi = 3.16 - 2.20 = 0.96$, is large enough to make the bond polar covalent: chlorine pulls the shared electron pair toward itself, creating a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) on Cl and a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) on H. Compare this to the C–H bond in methane, where $\Delta\chi = 2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35$ — small enough that the bond is treated as essentially nonpolar.

**Problem-solving application.** Electronegativity differences let you predict both bond type and molecular behavior without running an experiment. As a rule of thumb: $\Delta\chi < 0.5$ indicates a nonpolar covalent bond, $0.5 \le \Delta\chi < 1.7$ indicates a polar covalent bond, and $\Delta\chi \ge 1.7$ indicates a bond that is predominantly ionic. Apply this to NaCl: $\chi_{\text{Cl}} - \chi_{\text{Na}} = 3.16 - 0.93 = 2.23$, correctly predicting an ionic bond. This same logic extends to predicting molecular polarity: in CO$_2$, each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta\chi = 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89$), but the linear geometry causes the two bond dipoles to cancel, making the overall molecule nonpolar — a reminder that electronegativity predicts bond polarity, while molecular polarity also depends on geometry. This combined reasoning is essential for predicting solubility, boiling points, and reactivity patterns across organic and inorganic chemistry.

## Polar Covalent Bond

When two atoms share electrons unequally, the bond between them is a polar covalent bond. This happens whenever the atoms differ in electronegativity — the tendency of an atom to pull shared electrons toward itself. If the electronegativity difference is small (roughly 0 to 0.4 on the Pauling scale), the bond is essentially nonpolar covalent, with electrons shared almost equally. If the difference is large (above about 1.7), electrons are transferred rather than shared, and the bond is ionic instead. Polar covalent bonds occupy the middle ground, typically a difference between 0.4 and 1.7. The more electronegative atom acquires a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$), and the less electronegative atom acquires a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$), even though no full electron transfer occurs.

**Worked example.** Consider the H–Cl bond in hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen has an electronegativity of about 2.20, and chlorine has about 3.16, giving a difference of 0.96. Chlorine pulls the shared electron pair closer to itself, producing $H^{\delta+}$—$Cl^{\delta-}$. This is why HCl has a permanent dipole moment (about 1.08 D) and dissolves readily in water, where it ionizes almost completely into $H^+$ and $Cl^-$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a molecule's bonds and asked to predict overall polarity — a task that appears constantly in organic chemistry and biochemistry when predicting solubility, reactivity, or intermolecular forces. The procedure is: (1) calculate the electronegativity difference for each bond to classify it as nonpolar, polar covalent, or ionic; (2) determine the direction of each bond dipole using the electronegativity values; (3) consider the molecular geometry, since individual bond dipoles can cancel by symmetry even if each bond is individually polar. Carbon dioxide illustrates step 3: each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta EN \approx 0.89$), but the linear geometry makes the two dipoles point in opposite directions, canceling to give a nonpolar molecule overall. Water, by contrast, is bent, so its two O–H bond dipoles reinforce rather than cancel, making $H_2O$ strongly polar. This distinction — polar bonds versus polar molecules — is the key problem-solving skill: bond polarity is necessary but not sufficient to predict molecular polarity; geometry always has the final say.

---

## Molecule

A molecule is a group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds, arranged in a fixed ratio and geometry that determines the substance's identity and properties. Bonds form because atoms share or transfer electrons to reach a more stable electron configuration — typically a filled outer shell. Two atoms of the same element can bond (O$_2$, N$_2$), or different elements can combine (H$_2$O, CO$_2$). The molecular formula tells you *what* atoms are present and in what count; the molecular structure tells you *how* they're arranged in space, and structure is often what governs behavior.

**Worked example.** Consider water, H$_2$O. Two hydrogen atoms each share one electron with oxygen, forming two covalent bonds. Because oxygen holds the shared electrons more tightly than hydrogen (it's more electronegative), the bonding electrons sit closer to oxygen. This makes the oxygen end of the molecule slightly negative and the hydrogen ends slightly positive — a polar molecule. The bent shape (not linear) results from oxygen's two lone electron pairs pushing the hydrogens together at about $104.5°$. This polarity and geometry explain why water dissolves salts, forms hydrogen bonds with itself (giving it a high boiling point relative to its size), and beads up on a waxy, nonpolar surface.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given two compounds, CO$_2$ and SO$_2$, and asked to predict which one is polar. Both have a central atom double-bonded to two oxygens, so you can't rely on the formula alone — you need the structure. CO$_2$ is linear: the two C=O bond dipoles point in exactly opposite directions and cancel, making the molecule nonpolar overall even though each bond is polar. SO$_2$ is bent, like water, because sulfur carries a lone pair that bends the molecule; the two S=O dipoles don't cancel, so SO$_2$ is polar. This is the general problem-solving move for molecules: identify the atoms and bonds from the formula, then determine geometry (using lone pairs and bonding pairs around the central atom) before concluding anything about polarity, reactivity, or physical properties. Formula alone is rarely enough — shape is what connects a molecule's composition to its real-world behavior.

---

## Hydrogen Bond

A hydrogen bond is a weak, noncovalent attraction that forms when a hydrogen atom, already covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (typically N, O, or F), is drawn toward a lone pair of electrons on another electronegative atom nearby. The bond within the molecule (say, O–H) is polar: oxygen pulls electron density toward itself, leaving the hydrogen with a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) and the electronegative atom with a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$). When that exposed $\delta^+$ hydrogen encounters a $\delta^-$ atom on a neighboring molecule, an electrostatic attraction forms — the hydrogen bond. It is far weaker than a covalent bond (roughly 5–30 kJ/mol versus 400+ kJ/mol) but far stronger than typical van der Waals forces, and it is directional, forming preferentially in a nearly straight line between donor and acceptor.

**Worked example.** Consider water, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Each molecule has two $\delta^+$ hydrogens and two lone pairs on oxygen ($\delta^-$), so a single water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighbors — two as donor, two as acceptor. This extensive network explains why water has an unusually high boiling point (100°C) compared to structurally similar molecules like $\text{H}_2\text{S}$ (boiling at $-60$°C), even though sulfur is heavier than oxygen: hydrogen bonding, not just molecular mass, dominates the intermolecular forces holding water together.

**Problem-solving application.** Predicting whether a molecule can hydrogen-bond, and how strongly, is a practical skill used constantly in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Given a molecule, check two things: (1) does it have an H directly bonded to N, O, or F (a donor)? and (2) does it have an available lone pair on N, O, or F (an acceptor)? Methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) has both, so it hydrogen-bonds and boils at 65°C, far above the nonpolar, similarly sized ethane ($-89$°C). This same logic explains why DNA's two strands zip together through hydrogen bonds between base pairs (A–T forms two, G–C forms three), why proteins fold into stable secondary structures like $\alpha$-helices, and why hydrogen-bonding solvents like water dissolve polar solutes efficiently. When solving problems about boiling points, solubility, or biomolecular stability, always ask first whether hydrogen bonding is possible — it usually explains the anomaly.

## Water Polarity

Water's chemical formula, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, hides the geometric and electrical asymmetry that makes it one of the most consequential molecules in chemistry and biology. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen — it pulls the shared bonding electrons in each O–H bond closer to itself. This unequal sharing leaves oxygen with a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) and each hydrogen with a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$). Because the molecule is bent (roughly 104.5° between the two O–H bonds, not linear), these charge imbalances don't cancel out. The result is a *polar* molecule: one with a permanent, unevenly distributed charge, often summarized as a molecular dipole.

**Worked example.** Compare water to carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$. Both molecules contain polar bonds — carbon and oxygen also differ in electronegativity. But $\text{CO}_2$ is linear, with the two C=O bond dipoles pointing in exactly opposite directions. They cancel, so $\text{CO}_2$ is a nonpolar molecule overall. Water's bent shape prevents this cancellation: the two O–H dipoles add together instead, producing a net dipole pointing from the hydrogens toward the oxygen. This comparison shows that polarity depends on both bond character *and* molecular geometry — you cannot predict it from the atoms alone.

**Problem-solving application.** Polarity explains why water dissolves salts and sugars but not oils. When table salt (NaCl) is added to water, the $\delta^-$ oxygen ends of surrounding water molecules orient toward $\text{Na}^+$ ions, while the $\delta^+$ hydrogens orient toward $\text{Cl}^-$ ions — the ionic bond is overwhelmed, and the salt dissolves. Oils, made of nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, have no charge separation for water to interact with, so water molecules preferentially bond to each other, excluding the oil — the basis of the phrase "oil and water don't mix." If you're asked to predict whether a new compound will be water-soluble, the practical test is: does it have charged or highly electronegative atoms (like O, N, or charged groups) that can form these attractive interactions with water's partial charges? If yes, expect solubility; if it's a long, uniform hydrocarbon chain, expect it to resist mixing with water.

## Adhesion

Adhesion is the attractive force between water molecules and a different substance — a surface, a molecule, or an ion that is not itself water. It arises from the same source as cohesion (the hydrogen bonding that holds water molecules to each other): water's polarity. Because a water molecule carries a partial negative charge near its oxygen and partial positive charges near its hydrogens, it can form electrostatic attractions with any surface that presents its own charges or polar groups — glass, cellulose in a plant's xylem, or the polar groups on the inside of a narrow tube.

Adhesion and cohesion together explain capillary action, the rise of water through narrow channels against gravity. Consider a thin glass tube (a capillary) dipped in water. Water molecules adhere to the glass wall, climbing upward along it because glass surfaces have polar (in this case, hydroxyl) groups that hydrogen-bond with water. As the edge of the water column is pulled upward by adhesion, cohesion pulls the rest of the water column along with it, since the molecules in that column are hydrogen-bonded to each other. The narrower the tube, the higher the water climbs, because surface area of glass contact (favoring adhesion) grows faster relative to the volume of water that must be lifted than does the tube's cross-section (which governs weight).

This is not merely a demonstration for a chemistry lab — it is the physical mechanism that helps trees move water upward through xylem vessels, sometimes tens of meters, against gravity, without any pump. The xylem walls are lined with cellulose, rich in polar hydroxyl groups, so adhesion anchors water to the vessel walls while cohesion (aided by transpiration pulling water from the top) drags the connected column upward.

To apply this concept as a problem: suppose two capillary tubes of different radii are placed in the same water sample. Predict which tube shows a higher water column, and explain your prediction using adhesion and cohesion rather than simply citing "capillary action" as an unexplained label. The correct answer — the narrower tube shows the higher column — should be justified by reasoning about the ratio of wall-adhesion contact to water weight, not by memorized recall.

## Cohesion

Cohesion is the tendency of like molecules to stick to one another. In water, cohesion arises from hydrogen bonding: each water molecule is polar, with a partial negative charge on its oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on its hydrogen atoms. The oxygen of one molecule is weakly attracted to the hydrogen of a neighboring molecule, forming a hydrogen bond. No single hydrogen bond is strong, but water molecules form and re-form these bonds constantly, and collectively they create a network that gives liquid water much of its distinctive behavior — including surface tension, the tendency of the water surface to resist an external force.

**Worked example.** Picture a water strider standing on a pond. At the surface, water molecules experience an imbalance: molecules below them are pulled in all directions by neighbors, but molecules at the very top have no water above them to bond with. The result is a net inward pull at the surface, which pulls the surface molecules tightly together into something like a thin, taut membrane. This membrane resists being stretched or broken, which is why the water strider's weight, spread across its thin legs, is not enough to break through — the insect is literally supported by the cohesive forces between water molecules at the surface.

**Problem-solving application.** Cohesion explains several everyday and biological phenomena, and recognizing it helps you predict behavior in new situations. Consider why a small steel paperclip, denser than water, can float if placed carefully on the surface, while a larger, similarly dense object sinks immediately: the paperclip's weight is distributed across enough surface area that the cohesive "skin" can support it, whereas a larger object exceeds the strength of that skin. The same principle explains why water forms rounded droplets rather than spreading into a flat sheet — cohesion minimizes the surface area of the droplet, pulling it into a shape close to a sphere. In biology, cohesion (paired with adhesion, water's attraction to other surfaces) drives capillary action, helping water rise through the narrow vessels of plants. When you encounter an unfamiliar scenario involving water's surface behavior — insects walking on water, water beading on a waxed car, thin water columns holding together in a straw — ask first whether cohesive forces between water molecules are strong enough to counteract the force in question, such as gravity or an applied weight.

## Capillary Action

Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow through a narrow space — a thin tube, a gap between fibers, or the pores of a porous material — without help from gravity, and sometimes directly against it. It happens because of a competition between two forces: adhesion, the attraction between liquid molecules and the surface of the tube, and cohesion, the attraction between liquid molecules and each other. When adhesion to the tube walls is stronger than cohesion within the liquid, the liquid "wets" the surface and climbs; when cohesion dominates, the liquid resists the surface and is pushed down, as mercury does in a glass tube.

The height a liquid rises in a narrow tube can be predicted quantitatively, because the phenomenon is a genuine force balance. The upward pull comes from surface tension acting around the inner circumference of the tube, while the downward pull is the weight of the risen liquid column. Setting these equal gives the Jurin's law relation:

$$h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}$$

where $\gamma$ is the liquid's surface tension, $\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube wall, $\rho$ is the liquid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $r$ is the tube's inner radius. The key insight is the inverse relationship with $r$: halving the radius doubles the rise height. This is why capillary action is negligible in a drinking straw but dramatic in the microscopic vessels of a plant stem or the tiny gaps of a paper towel.

**Worked example.** A glass capillary tube with radius $r = 0.10\text{ mm}$ is dipped in water at $20^\circ\text{C}$, where $\gamma = 0.0728\text{ N/m}$, $\rho = 1000\text{ kg/m}^3$, and the contact angle with clean glass is nearly $0^\circ$ ($\cos\theta \approx 1$). Then:

$$h = \frac{2(0.0728)(1)}{(1000)(9.8)(0.0001)} \approx 0.149\text{ m} \approx 15\text{ cm}$$

**Problem-solving application.** This formula lets engineers and biologists reason quantitatively about real systems: estimating the maximum height water can passively rise in xylem vessels of a given diameter, sizing wick channels in fuel gauges or diagnostic test strips (as in lateral-flow assays), or predicting whether a soil's pore size will retain moisture against gravity during drought. Given any three of $\gamma$, $\theta$, $\rho$, or $r$, students can solve for the fourth — for instance, determining the maximum pore radius soil must have to wick water to a 30 cm root depth.

## Payoff

Capillary action is the rise or fall of a liquid inside a narrow space without external pumping — the net result of adhesion (liquid molecules bonding to the container wall), cohesion (liquid molecules bonding to each other), and surface tension (the energetic cost of exposing a liquid surface to air). When adhesion to the wall exceeds cohesion within the liquid, the fluid climbs; when cohesion dominates, as with mercury in glass, the liquid is pushed down instead. It is the natural endpoint of this text because it is where every earlier idea — intermolecular forces, surface energy, pressure balance, and fluid equilibrium — converges into a single observable phenomenon that a reader can watch happen in a glass of water with a thin tube.

The height a liquid climbs is governed by the Young–Laplace relation balancing surface tension against gravity:
$$h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}$$
where $\gamma$ is surface tension, $\theta$ is the contact angle between liquid and wall, $\rho$ is liquid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $r$ is the tube radius. This equation is unavoidable here — it is the only correct account of why height is inversely proportional to radius, and no plain-language description substitutes for it. A worked check: for water ($\gamma = 0.073\text{ N/m}$, $\theta \approx 0°$) in a tube of radius $r = 0.1\text{ mm}$, $h \approx 15\text{ cm}$ — narrow enough to matter in plants and porous rock, wide enough to be negligible in a drinking glass.

This single equation radiates outward into every application this concept unlocks. In plant biology, it explains how trees pull water dozens of meters upward through xylem vessels far narrower than any pump could justify. In materials science, it governs how ink wicks into paper, how sap moves through wood, and how coatings absorb into porous ceramics. In medicine, it underlies point-of-care diagnostic strips and blood-collection microtubes. In geology, it dictates how groundwater migrates through soil pores against gravity. In engineering, it drives the design of heat pipes, fabric wicking in athletic clothing, and lab-on-a-chip microfluidic devices.

From here, choose one domain and follow the radius term downward: what happens to a heat pipe's performance, or a diagnostic strip's response time, as $r$ shrinks toward the microfluidic limit?
