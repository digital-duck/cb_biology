## Lung Volume

Lung volume refers to the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs during a single, distinct phase of breathing. Unlike lung *capacity*, which is the sum of two or more volumes, each lung volume is a discrete, non-overlapping quantity. Pulmonologists recognize four standard volumes: tidal volume (air moved in a normal, quiet breath), inspiratory reserve volume (extra air that can be forcibly inhaled after a normal inhalation), expiratory reserve volume (extra air that can be forcibly exhaled after a normal exhalation), and residual volume (air that remains in the lungs even after maximal exhalation, preventing alveolar collapse). Volumes are measured in liters or milliliters and typically assessed using a spirometer, a device that records the volume and rate of air movement over time.

**Worked example.** Consider a healthy adult with the following measured volumes: tidal volume (TV) = 0.5 L, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) = 3.0 L, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = 1.1 L, and residual volume (RV) = 1.2 L. A spirometer trace shows breathing cycling steadily at TV, then a deep forced inhalation adds the IRV on top of the last normal inhalation. To find the vital capacity — the maximum air a person can exhale after maximal inhalation — sum the three volumes a spirometer can actually measure: $VC = TV + IRV + ERV = 0.5 + 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.6\text{ L}$. Residual volume is excluded because it cannot be exhaled, and standard spirometry cannot measure it directly; it requires specialized techniques like helium dilution or body plethysmography.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a patient's total lung capacity (TLC), measured by plethysmography, is 6.0 L, and their vital capacity from spirometry is 4.4 L. Since $TLC = VC + RV$, the residual volume can be inferred without direct measurement: $RV = TLC - VC = 6.0 - 4.4 = 1.6\text{ L}$. This kind of reasoning — using measurable volumes to back out an unmeasurable one — is exactly how clinicians screen for conditions like emphysema, where trapped air raises RV, or restrictive diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, where nearly all volumes shrink. Interpreting a spirometry report is fundamentally an exercise in comparing a patient's measured volumes against age-, sex-, and height-adjusted reference values to flag abnormal patterns.

## Lung Capacity

Lung volumes describe discrete quantities of air a lung can hold or move under specific conditions. Lung capacities combine two or more of these volumes to describe functionally meaningful states of the respiratory system. The four standard capacities are: **inspiratory capacity** (tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume), the maximum air inhaled after a normal exhale; **functional residual capacity** (expiratory reserve volume + residual volume), the air remaining after a normal exhale; **vital capacity** (tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume + expiratory reserve volume), the maximum air that can be forcibly exhaled after a maximal inhale; and **total lung capacity** (vital capacity + residual volume), the absolute maximum air the lungs can hold.

**Worked example.** Suppose a patient's spirometry test reports: tidal volume (TV) = 500 mL, inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) = 3,000 mL, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) = 1,100 mL, and residual volume (RV) = 1,200 mL. Vital capacity is $VC = TV + IRV + ERV = 500 + 3{,}000 + 1{,}100 = 4{,}600$ mL. Total lung capacity is $TLC = VC + RV = 4{,}600 + 1{,}200 = 5{,}800$ mL. Note that residual volume cannot be measured by spirometry alone, since it is air that never leaves the lungs; it requires techniques like helium dilution or body plethysmography, so any capacity that includes RV (functional residual capacity, total lung capacity) depends on that supplementary measurement.

**Problem-solving application.** Clinicians use capacities, not raw volumes, to diagnose disease patterns because capacities isolate functionally relevant air pools. A reduced vital capacity with a normal or increased residual volume suggests an *obstructive* pattern (e.g., emphysema), where air is trapped and cannot be exhaled — RV rises, inflating both FRC and TLC even as VC shrinks. A reduced vital capacity accompanied by a reduced total lung capacity instead suggests a *restrictive* pattern (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), where the lung's overall expandability is limited, so every compartment shrinks together. Given a patient's TV, IRV, ERV, and RV, you can compute all four capacities and classify the likely pattern: check whether $TLC$ is elevated (obstructive) or diminished (restrictive) relative to a normal range (roughly 5–6 L for an adult), and cross-check by comparing VC against TLC to isolate whether the deficit originates in reserve volumes or in RV itself.

## Spirometry

Spirometry is the standard clinical technique for measuring how much air a person moves into and out of their lungs, and how quickly. A patient breathes through a mouthpiece connected to a spirometer, which records airflow or volume over time as a spirogram. From this single trace, clinicians extract several key quantities: tidal volume (the air moved in a normal, relaxed breath), vital capacity (the maximum air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation), and forced expiratory volume in one second, or $FEV_1$ (how much air a person can forcefully blow out in the first second of a maximal exhalation). The ratio $FEV_1/FVC$, where $FVC$ is forced vital capacity, is the single most useful number in the test, because it distinguishes two fundamentally different kinds of lung disease.

Consider a patient who exhales a total of 4.0 liters (their $FVC$) and manages to push out 3.6 liters of that within the first second. Their $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio is $3.6/4.0 = 0.90$, or 90%. This is normal — healthy adults typically clear at least 70–80% of their vital capacity in the first second, because healthy airways offer little resistance to fast airflow. Now consider a patient with the same $FVC$ of 4.0 liters but an $FEV_1$ of only 2.0 liters, giving a ratio of 50%. This pattern — reduced airflow despite largely preserved total volume — is the hallmark of an obstructive disease such as asthma or COPD, where narrowed or collapsing airways slow exhalation even though the lungs can still hold a normal amount of air.

Spirometry becomes a genuine problem-solving tool once you compare it against a restrictive pattern. A patient with pulmonary fibrosis might have both $FVC$ and $FEV_1$ reduced proportionally — say $FVC = 2.5$ L and $FEV_1 = 2.1$ L, giving a ratio of 84%, even higher than normal. Here the lungs are stiff and simply cannot expand to a normal volume, but airflow through open airways remains fast. A physician reading these two numbers together — total volume and the fraction expelled quickly — can classify a patient's disease as obstructive, restrictive, or normal before ordering further imaging, illustrating how a simple ratio derived from a breathing test encodes real diagnostic information.

## Payoff

Every concept in this book — measurement, rate, ratio, threshold, and classification — converges here, in a single breath forced through a tube. Spirometry takes the abstract idea of "quantifying a process over time" and applies it to something as intimate as human breathing. A patient exhales as hard and fast as possible into a sensor, and the machine records volume against time, producing a curve that compresses an enormous amount of physiological information into one measurement session. What spirometry achieves is diagnostic clarity without invasive procedures: it distinguishes between diseases that obstruct airflow (like asthma or COPD) and diseases that restrict lung expansion (like pulmonary fibrosis), simply by analyzing the shape and key values of that exhalation curve. This is the natural endpoint of the book because it demonstrates that every mathematical tool you've learned — rates of change, ratios, percentages, reference ranges, and classification logic — exists not for its own sake, but to convert raw data into a decision that affects someone's treatment plan.

The clearest illustration is the application this concept unlocks: the FEV1/FVC ratio. FEV1 is the volume of air a patient can force out in the first second of exhalation; FVC is the total volume they can force out entirely. Their ratio, $\text{FEV1/FVC}$, is not just a number — it is a diagnostic signature. A healthy adult typically exhales 75–80% of their total lung capacity within that first second. When obstruction is present, airways narrow and air escapes more slowly, so FEV1 drops sharply while FVC stays relatively intact, pushing the ratio below 70%. In restrictive disease, both FEV1 and FVC shrink together, so the ratio often stays normal even though total lung function is impaired. This single computed value — a ratio you could calculate by hand — becomes the pivot point of an entire clinical decision tree, echoing every earlier lesson on how a well-chosen ratio can reveal a mechanism that raw numbers alone would hide.

From here, the natural next step is to explore the FEV1/FVC ratio in depth: how it is measured, how reference thresholds are established across age and sex, and how clinicians use it alongside other spirometry values to arrive at a diagnosis.
